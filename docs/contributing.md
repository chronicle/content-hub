### How to get access to Google SecOps for development purposes

In order to get access to the Google SecOps platform, you need to submit
this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7LYpIPhzFAYLo2NPpl5NUBX6h2zG4rDlLjWjm2Ic_U2FhZg/viewform). The form will be triaged by our Partner Management team. We might reach out to get more details. If everything is resolved, you will receive a Development License and access to Google SecOps. 

If you already have access to Google SecOps through mutual customers/partners, then you can skip this step and start contributing.
