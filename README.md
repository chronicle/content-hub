👋 Hello and welcome!

This repository is the central hub for a wide array of community-contributed content intended to
enhance the Google SecOps platform.

## How it Works

The Content Hub operates on a principle of collaborative development. Integrations and playbooks are developed here, verified, and then published to the Google SecOps Content-Hub.


From normalizing and transforming telemetry for ingestion, to
connecting Google SecOps with other security tools, to exploring practical use-cases and leveraging
powerful development packages -- anything needed to enhance the Google Security Operations
experience lives here.
