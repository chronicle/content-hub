    description: Tests the connectivity between Google SecOps and the GitSync integration
      components. It validates the connection to the Chronicle SOAR API by retrieving
      the system version and verifies access to the specified Git repository using
      credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or SSH keys. The action also
      confirms the availability of the target branch and can optionally perform SSH
      host key verification if a Git server fingerprint is provided. This is primarily
      used as a diagnostic tool to ensure the integration is correctly configured.
