    description: Creates a case in Torq by triggering a workflow via a Webhook. The
      action sends the current alert's metadata, including associated entities and
      properties, to Torq to initiate automated response logic. It supports idempotency
      through deduplication and correlation keys and can optionally poll the Torq
      Public API to retrieve the final execution status and output data, which is
      then attached to the action results in Google SecOps.
    external_data_mutation_explanation: Invokes a Torq workflow via a Webhook POST
      request, which initiates processes or case management actions within the Torq
      platform.

    description: Sends a trigger (ping) to a Torq workflow via a Webhook and optionally
      polls the Torq Public API for the execution status and results. The action transmits
      metadata about the current Google SecOps case, including case ID, name, and
      environment, as a JSON payload. It supports asynchronous execution by monitoring
      the workflow's progress based on user-defined polling intervals and maximum
      durations, returning the final workflow output and execution details.

    description: Triggers a **Torq workflow** via a webhook POST request, passing
      a custom JSON input and optionally including the current alert's context and
      entity data. If Torq API credentials (Client ID/Secret or Bearer Token) are
      provided, the action performs asynchronous polling of the **Torq Public API**
      to retrieve the final execution status, ID, and workflow output. This action
      enables seamless integration between Google SecOps and external Torq automation
      logic.
