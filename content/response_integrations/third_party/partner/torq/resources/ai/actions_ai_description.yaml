    description: Initiates a case in Torq by invoking a specific workflow via a Webhook.
      The action transmits the current alert's metadata, context, and associated entities
      to Torq, facilitating external orchestration. It supports optional deduplication
      and correlation keys for incident management and idempotency. If Torq API credentials
      (or a Bearer override) are provided, the action polls the Torq Public API to
      retrieve the final execution status and output, which is then attached to the
      action results in Google SecOps.

    description: Sends a ping request to a Torq workflow via a Webhook POST request
      to verify connectivity and trigger external processes. The action utilizes a
      'secret' header for authentication and can optionally poll the Torq Public API
      to monitor the execution status and retrieve final results. It supports configurable
      polling intervals and timeout durations to handle asynchronous workflow responses,
      providing detailed execution data, including execution IDs and status codes,
      back to the SOAR environment.

    description: Executes a specified Torq workflow by sending a JSON payload to a
      Torq webhook. The action can include the current alert's context, including
      its metadata and associated entities, as part of the request. If Torq API credentials
      are provided, the action will poll the Torq Public API to track the workflow's
      execution progress and retrieve the final results, which are then returned as
      a JSON object.
