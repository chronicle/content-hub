    ### General Description

    The **Enrich Asset Information** action retrieves detailed asset metadata from
    the CylusOne platform for IP Address entities. It provides security analysts with
    deep context regarding the hardware, software, and network properties of an asset
    identified by its IP address, helping to identify the nature of the device involved
    in an alert.


    ### Parameters

    There are no user-configurable parameters for this action.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Entity Validation**: The action iterates through the target entities and
    filters for those of type `ADDRESS`. It also validates that the identifier follows
    a valid IPv4 address format.

    2. **Data Retrieval**: For each valid IP, the action performs a GET request to
    the CylusOne API endpoint `/rest/v1/assets/by-ip` to fetch associated asset information.

    3. **Data Transformation**: The retrieved asset data is flattened and namespaced.
    Specific fields such as `ips`, `macs`, and custom properties are processed and
    prefixed with `Cylus_` (e.g., `Cylus_prop_asset_name`) to ensure clarity and avoid
    data collisions.

    4. **Enrichment**: The processed metadata is added to the entity's `additional_properties`
    attribute within Google SecOps, and the entity's `is_enriched` status is set to
    `True`.

    5. **Update**: The action updates the entities in the Google SecOps platform to
    persist the enrichment data and returns a summary of successfully enriched and
    failed entities.

Ping:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nThe **Ping** action is a connectivity\
    \ test utility for the **CylusOne** integration. Its primary purpose is to verify\
    \ that the Google SecOps environment can successfully communicate with the CylusOne\
    \ platform using the configured credentials and network settings. It performs\
    \ a basic API call to ensure the API key is valid and the endpoint is reachable.\n\
    \n### Parameters Description\nThis action does not require any user-provided input\
    \ parameters at the time of execution. It utilizes the global integration configuration\
    \ parameters:\n* **Base URL**: The root URL of the CylusOne API instance.\n* **Cylus\
    \ API Key**: The authentication token used to authorize requests.\n* **Verify\
    \ SSL**: A boolean flag determining whether to validate the SSL certificate of\
    \ the target server.\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis action is typically used during\
    \ the initial setup of the integration or for troubleshooting connection issues.\
    \ It does not process any entities from the case and does not modify any data\
    \ within Google SecOps or CylusOne.\n\n### Flow Description\n1. **Parameter Extraction**:\
    \ The action retrieves the Base URL, API Key, and SSL verification settings from\
    \ the integration configuration.\n2. **API Initialization**: An internal API manager\
    \ is initialized with the retrieved settings.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: The\
    \ action executes a `GET` request to the `/rest/v1/assets/by-ip` endpoint using\
    \ a dummy IP address (`10.0.0.5`) to test the response.\n4. **Response Evaluation**:\
    \ \n    * A status code of `200` or `404` is treated as a successful connection\
    \ (indicating the service is reachable and the API key is accepted).\n    * A\
    \ status code of `401` or `403` indicates an authentication or permission failure.\n\
    \    * Network timeouts or connection errors result in a failed execution state.\n\
    5. **Result Reporting**: The action concludes by providing a success or failure\
    \ message to the user."
