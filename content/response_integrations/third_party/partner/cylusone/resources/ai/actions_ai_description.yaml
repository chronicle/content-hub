EnrichAssetInformation:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nEnriches IP address entities with detailed\
    \ asset information retrieved from the CylusOne platform. This action is designed\
    \ to provide security analysts with deeper context regarding network assets, including\
    \ associated MAC addresses, IP lists, and custom asset properties defined within\
    \ CylusOne.\n\n### Parameters Description\nThis action does not have any input\
    \ parameters. It utilizes the integration's global configuration (Base URL and\
    \ API Key) and the identifiers of the target entities.\n\n### Flow Description\n\
    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the Cylus API Manager using the\
    \ integration's base URL and API key.\n2. **Entity Filtering**: It iterates through\
    \ the target entities provided in the context, selecting only those of type **ADDRESS**.\n\
    3. **Validation**: Each entity identifier is validated to ensure it follows a\
    \ standard IPv4 address format.\n4. **Data Retrieval**: For each valid IP, the\
    \ action queries the Cylus API (`/rest/v1/assets/by-ip`) to fetch asset details.\n\
    5. **Data Transformation**: \n    - If an asset is found, its attributes (like\
    \ MACs and IPs) are extracted.\n    - Custom properties from the asset are flattened\
    \ and namespaced with a `Cylus_prop_` prefix.\n6. **Enrichment**: The retrieved\
    \ data is added to the entity's 'additional properties' in Google SecOps, and\
    \ the entity is marked as enriched.\n7. **Update**: The action updates the entities\
    \ in the case and provides a JSON summary of all retrieved data.\n\n### Additional\
    \ Notes\n- Only IPv4 addresses are supported; other entity types or malformed\
    \ IP strings will be skipped with a failure status recorded for that specific\
    \ entity.\n- The action namespaces all enriched fields with the `Cylus_` prefix\
    \ to prevent data collisions."

      Updates the internal Google SecOps entity by adding enriched asset information
      (MACs, properties, etc.) to its additional properties and setting the 'is_enriched'
      flag to true.

  ai_description: "### General Description\nTests the connectivity between Google\
    \ SecOps and the CylusOne platform. This action is used to verify that the configured\
    \ Base URL and API Key are correct and that the network path to the CylusOne instance\
    \ is open.\n\n### Parameters Description\nThis action does not have any input\
    \ parameters. It utilizes the global integration configuration parameters: \n\
    * **Base URL**: The root URL of the CylusOne instance.\n* **Cylus API Key**: The\
    \ API key used for authentication.\n* **Verify SSL**: A boolean flag to determine\
    \ if SSL certificates should be validated.\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis action\
    \ is a utility designed for troubleshooting and setup validation. It does not\
    \ process entities or modify any data within the CylusOne platform.\n\n### Flow\
    \ Description\n1. **Setup**: Initializes the action context and retrieves integration-level\
    \ credentials (API Key and Base URL).\n2. **API Interaction**: Uses the ApiManager\
    \ to perform a test GET request to a standard endpoint (`/rest/v1/assets/by-ip`)\
    \ using a dummy IP address.\n3. **Validation**: Analyzes the HTTP response status.\
    \ Success is defined as receiving a 200 (Found) or 404 (Not Found) status code,\
    \ which confirms the API is reachable and accepting the provided key.\n4. **Error\
    \ Handling**: Captures authentication failures (401/403) or connection timeouts\
    \ to provide specific error messages in the output.\n5. **Completion**: Reports\
    \ whether the connection was successfully established."
