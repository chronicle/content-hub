    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a diagnostic utility designed to verify the connectivity
    and authentication status between the Google SecOps environment and the **ANY.RUN
    TI Feeds** service. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the integration is correctly
    configured and that the network path (including optional proxies) is open.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | **ANYRUN TI Feeds API key** | String | Yes | The API key used to authenticate
    requests to the ANY.RUN TI Feeds service. |

    | **Verify SSL** | Boolean | No | Determines whether to verify the SSL certificate
    of the ANY.RUN API endpoint. |

    | **Enable proxy** | Boolean | No | If enabled, the action will attempt to route
    the connection through a proxy server. |

    | **Proxy host** | String | No | The hostname or IP address of the proxy server.
    Required if 'Enable proxy' is set to true. |

    | **Proxy port** | String | No | The port number of the proxy server. Required
    if 'Enable proxy' is set to true. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not interact with any entities (IPs, Domains, etc.) and is
    used solely for system health and configuration checks.

    - The parameters are typically sourced from the integration's global configuration
    but are validated during the execution of this action.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action extracts the API key, SSL verification
    settings, and proxy configuration.

    2. **Proxy Connectivity Test**: If proxying is enabled, the action first validates
    that it can establish a connection through the specified proxy server.

    3. **Authentication Verification**: The action uses the `FeedsConnector` to call
    the `check_authorization` method, which performs a lightweight request to the
    ANY.RUN API to confirm the API key is valid.

    4. **Status Reporting**: The action concludes by providing a success message if
    all checks pass, or an error message detailing the failure (e.g., invalid API
    key or network timeout).
