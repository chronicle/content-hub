    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a diagnostic utility designed to verify connectivity between
    the Google SecOps platform and the **ANY.RUN TI Feeds** service. Its primary purpose
    is to ensure that the provided API credentials and network configurations (including
    proxy settings) are valid and that the service is reachable.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action primarily utilizes configuration parameters defined at the integration
    level rather than action-specific parameters.


    | Parameter Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | ANYRUN TI Feeds API key | String | Yes | The API key used to authenticate with
    the ANY.RUN TI Feeds service. |

    | Verify SSL | Boolean | No | If enabled, the action will verify the SSL certificate
    of the ANY.RUN server. |

    | Enable proxy | Boolean | No | If enabled, the action will attempt to connect
    to the service via a proxy server. |

    | Proxy host | String | No (Mandatory if proxy enabled) | The hostname or IP address
    of the proxy server. |

    | Proxy port | String | No (Mandatory if proxy enabled) | The port number used
    by the proxy server. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not interact with any entities or modify any data within the
    SOAR or the external system.

    - It is typically used during the initial setup of the integration or for troubleshooting
    connectivity issues.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Extraction**: The script retrieves the integration configuration, including
    the API key, SSL verification preference, and proxy settings.

    2. **Proxy Validation (Optional)**: If the 'Enable proxy' flag is set, the script
    attempts to initialize a connection through the specified proxy host and port
    to verify the proxy configuration.

    3. **Authorization Check**: The script initializes a connection to the ANY.RUN
    Feeds service and executes a `check_authorization` call to validate the API key.

    4. **Result Reporting**: Based on the success or failure of the connection and
    authorization, the script logs the outcome and ends the action with a status of
    `COMPLETED` (success) or `FAILED`.
