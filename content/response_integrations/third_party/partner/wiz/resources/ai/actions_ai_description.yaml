    description: Retrieves comprehensive information about a specific issue in Wiz
      using its unique Issue ID. The action fetches detailed metadata including creation
      and update timestamps, current status, severity level, issue type, and a full

      entity (such as cloud platform, region, and subscription), associated projects,
      and the source rules that triggered the issue. This information is returned
      as a JSON result for use in subsequent playbook steps and automated decision-making.

      and that the network connection to the Wiz server is established.

    description: Reopens a specific issue in Wiz using its unique identifier. This
      action communicates with the Wiz GraphQL API to perform a status update on an
      existing issue, changing its state to 'OPEN'. It takes a mandatory Issue ID

      This is useful for workflows where an issue needs to be re-evaluated after remediation
      efforts or if it was previously closed in error.
