    description: Executes dynamic analysis of file attachments within an ANY.RUN Android
      sandbox environment. The action handles file submission, environment configuration
      (network, locale, timeout), and retrieves a comprehensive analysis report. Results
      include a direct link to the interactive task, an HTML report attached to the
      case wall, and a summary of malicious or suspicious indicators of compromise
      (IOCs) identified during execution. It utilizes parameters such as timeout,
      privacy settings, and network options (Tor, FakeNet, MITM) to customize the
      sandbox behavior.

      ANY.RUN cloud environment by uploading a file attachment for execution.
