File Android Analysis:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action performs automated file analysis on a case attachment using the ANY.RUN
    Android Sandbox. It uploads the selected file to the ANY.RUN platform, configures
    the virtual environment according to user parameters (such as networking, locale,
    and timeout), and monitors the execution until completion. The action provides
    comprehensive results by posting interactive links, summary comments, and attaching
    full HTML reports directly to the case wall.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Timeout In Seconds | string | No | Sets the task execution duration. Valid range
    is 10 to 660 seconds (default 240). |

    | Change to valid extension | boolean | No | If true, automatically modifies the
    file extension to a valid format for execution. |

    | Command line | string | No | Optional arguments to pass to the file during execution.
    |

    | System's language | string | No | Configures the OS locale (e.g., 'en-US', 'Brazil').
    |

    | User Tags | string | No | Assigns custom tags to the ANY.RUN task (max 8 tags,
    16 chars each). |

    | Analysis Privacy Type | ddl | No | Defines task visibility: 'public', 'bylink',
    'owner', or 'byteam'. |

    the residential proxy. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action specifically targets the **first** attachment found in the Google
    SecOps case.

    - It requires a valid ANY.RUN API Key configured in the integration settings.

    - Because it creates a new analysis task and uploads a file, it is considered
    a mutation of external data.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization:** Retrieves API credentials and SSL settings from the integration
    configuration.

    2. **Attachment Retrieval:** Fetches the first available attachment from the current
    case.

    3. **Task Creation:** Uploads the file to ANY.RUN and starts a new Android Sandbox
    analysis with the specified network and environment parameters.

    4. **Link Sharing:** Posts a comment to the case with a direct URL to the interactive
    ANY.RUN task.

    5. **Monitoring:** Polls the ANY.RUN API to monitor the task's progress.

    6. **Report Generation:** Once complete, downloads the HTML report and attaches
    it to the Case Wall.

    7. **IOC Extraction:** Fetches Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from the task and
    posts a summary of suspicious or malicious indicators as a case comment.

    8. **Verdict:** Ends the action with the final analysis status (verdict) provided
    by the sandbox.

    such as running as a superuser, specifying the start folder, and defining network
    behavior (including Tor, FakeNet, or VPN/Proxy usage). Once the analysis is complete,
    the action retrieves the final verdict, summarizes malicious or suspicious indicators
    (IOCs) in a case comment, and attaches the full HTML analysis report directly

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The Ping action is a utility designed to test the connectivity between Google
    SecOps and the ANY.RUN Sandbox service. Its primary purpose is to verify that
    the configured API credentials and network settings (including SSL and proxy configurations)
    are correct and that the service is reachable.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any runtime parameters. It uses the following integration
    configuration parameters:

    * **ANYRUN Sandbox API KEY**: Mandatory. The API key used to authenticate with
    the ANY.RUN service.

    * **Verify SSL**: A boolean flag determining whether to verify the SSL certificate
    of the ANY.RUN server.

    * **Enable proxy**: A boolean flag to determine if a proxy should be used for
    the connection.

    * **Proxy host**: The hostname of the proxy server (required if proxy is enabled).

    * **Proxy port**: The port of the proxy server (required if proxy is enabled).


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Extraction**: The script extracts the API key and SSL verification settings
    from the integration configuration.

    2. **Proxy Verification**: If the 'Enable proxy' setting is active, the script
    extracts the proxy host and port, then attempts to verify the proxy connection
    using the `check_proxy` logic.

    3. **Authorization Check**: The action initializes a connection to the ANY.RUN
    Sandbox and calls the `check_authorization` method to ensure the API key is valid.

    4. **Completion**: If the connection and authorization are successful, the action
    returns a completion state with a success message. If a runtime exception occurs
    during any phase, the action reports a failure with the specific error message.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is strictly for diagnostic purposes and does not process or interact
    with case entities.
