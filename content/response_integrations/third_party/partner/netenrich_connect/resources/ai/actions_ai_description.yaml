    ### General Description

    This action is a connectivity test (Ping) designed to verify the communication
    between Google SecOps and the Resolution Intelligence Cloud (Netenrich). It ensures
    that the integration is correctly configured and the target API endpoint is reachable.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not utilize any runtime action parameters. Instead, it relies
    on the integration's configuration settings:


    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | RI Inbound Webhook URL | String | Yes | The base URL for the Resolution Intelligence
    inbound webhook, containing a placeholder for the token. |

    | Token | String | Yes | The API token used for authentication, which is injected
    into the webhook URL. |

    | Verify SSL | Boolean | No | Specifies whether to validate the SSL certificate
    of the connection. Defaults to True. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action is typically used during initial setup or troubleshooting to confirm
    network paths and credentials.

    - Interestingly, the logic treats both HTTP 200 (OK) and HTTP 400 (Bad Request)
    as successful pings, assuming that receiving a 400 indicates the server is reached
    and responding to the request format.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: Retrieves the mandatory configuration parameters (`RI Inbound
    Webhook URL`, `Token`, and `Verify SSL`) from the integration settings.

    2. **Request Preparation**: Constructs the final URL by replacing the `{token}`
    placeholder in the webhook URL with the provided API token.

    3. **Connectivity Check**: Executes an HTTP POST request with an empty JSON body
    to the target endpoint.

    4. **Result Evaluation**: Checks the HTTP response status code. If the code is
    200 or 400, the action reports a successful ping. For any other status code or
    if a connection error occurs, the action reports a failure and logs the error
    details.

      Performs an HTTP POST request to the Resolution Intelligence Cloud webhook.
      While the request body is empty and intended for connectivity testing, a POST
      request is technically a state-changing operation in REST architecture.
