      or CIDR ranges), address states (Free, Used, or Any), and tag-based criteria.
      It fetches detailed asset metadata including hostnames, current usage status,
      protocol details, and hardware (MAC) addresses. The results are presented in
      a structured data table and returned as raw JSON for use in subsequent playbook
      steps.
