Acknowledge Console Alert:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Acknowledge Console Alert** action is used to mark a specific alert as acknowledged
    within the Thinkst Canary console. This action is primarily used for workflow
    synchronization, ensuring that once an analyst has addressed an alert in Google
    SecOps, the corresponding incident in the Canary management platform is updated
    to reflect that it has been seen and handled.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any action-specific input parameters. It relies on the
    following **Integration Configuration** parameters:


    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | API Key | String | Yes | The API key used to authenticate with the Thinkst Canary
    Console. |

    | Console Hash | String | Yes | The unique identifier (subdomain) for your Canary
    Console (e.g., the 'mycompany' part of 'mycompany.canary.tools'). |

    | Verify SSL | Boolean | No | Whether to verify the SSL certificate of the Canary
    Console. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** The action retrieves the API Key, Console Hash,
    and SSL settings from the integration configuration.

    2. **Incident Identification:** It accesses the `security_events` of the current
    alert in Google SecOps.

    3. **ID Extraction:** It extracts the `AlertId` from the `additional_properties`
    of the first security event. This ID is expected to have been populated by the
    Thinkst connector during the ingestion process.

    4. **External API Call:** It performs a POST request to the Thinkst Canary API
    endpoint `/api/v1/incident/acknowledge` using the extracted incident ID.

    5. **Completion:** The action reports whether the acknowledgment was successful
    or if an error occurred (e.g., missing ID or API failure).


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action requires that the alert being processed was originally ingested
    via the Thinkst connector, as it relies on the `AlertId` metadata stored within
    the alert's security events.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a connectivity test designed to verify the communication
    between Google SecOps and the Thinkst Canary Console. It ensures that the provided
    credentials (API Key) and the instance identifier (Console Hash) are valid and
    that the network path is open.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | API Key | String | Yes | The API key used to authenticate with the Thinkst Canary
    Console. This is an integration configuration parameter. |

    | Console Hash | String | Yes | The unique identifier (subdomain) for your Canary
    Console instance. This is an integration configuration parameter. |

    | Verify SSL | Boolean | No | Determines whether to verify the SSL certificate
    of the Canary Console. This is an integration configuration parameter. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not require any input entities to run.

    - It relies entirely on the integration's configuration parameters.

    - If the API Key or Console Hash are left as default placeholders, the action
    will fail with an explicit error message.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction:** The action retrieves the API Key, Console Hash, and
    SSL verification settings from the integration configuration.

    2. **Validation:** It checks if the API Key and Console Hash have been changed
    from their default placeholder values.

    3. **Connection Initialization:** It initializes the Thinkst Action Manager with
    the provided credentials.

    4. **API Request:** It sends a GET request to the `/ping` endpoint of the Canary
    Console API.

    5. **Result Processing:** If the API returns a success message, the action completes
    successfully; otherwise, it reports a failure.
