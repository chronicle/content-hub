  ai_description: >-
    General description: The Ping action is designed to verify the connectivity between
    the Google SecOps platform and the Luminar IOCs and Leaked Credentials service.
    It ensures that the provided API credentials and the Base URL are valid and that
    the service is reachable. Parameters description: 1. Luminar API Client ID (String,
    Mandatory): The client identifier for the Luminar API, retrieved from integration
    configuration. 2. Luminar API Client Secret (String, Mandatory): The client secret
    for the Luminar API, retrieved from integration configuration. 3. Luminar API
    Account ID (String, Mandatory): The specific account ID for the realm, retrieved
    from integration configuration. 4. Luminar Base URL (String, Mandatory): The base
    URL for the Luminar API service, retrieved from integration configuration. Additional
    notes: This action does not interact with entities or alerts. It is strictly for
    integration configuration testing and uses integration-level parameters rather
    than action-specific ones. Flow description: 1. Credential Extraction: The action
    retrieves the API Client ID, Client Secret, Account ID, and Base URL from the
    integration configuration. 2. Manager Initialization: A LuminarManager instance
    is created with the retrieved credentials. 3. Connectivity Request: The manager
    executes a POST request to the Luminar token endpoint (/externalApi/realm/{account_id}/token)
    to attempt authentication. 4. Response Validation: The action checks the HTTP
    response status. Success (200 OK) indicates a valid connection, while 401, 403,
    400, or 404 errors indicate credential or configuration issues. 5. Result Reporting:
    The action reports the success or failure status and a corresponding message to
    the SOAR workbench.
