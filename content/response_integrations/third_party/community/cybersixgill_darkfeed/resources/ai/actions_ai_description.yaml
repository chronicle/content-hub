    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a utility designed to verify the connectivity and authentication
    between Google SecOps and the **Cybersixgill Darkfeed** API. It serves as a health
    check to ensure that the integration configuration (specifically the Client ID
    and Client Secret) is correct and that the network path to the Cybersixgill service
    is open.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any action-level parameters. It relies solely on the
    integration's global configuration settings:

    * **Client Id**: The unique identifier for your Cybersixgill API access.

    * **Client Secret**: The secret key associated with your Cybersixgill API access.


    ### Additional Notes

    There are no specific input parameters to configure when running this action.
    It is typically used during the initial setup of the integration or for troubleshooting
    connection issues.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the connection using the provided
    integration credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).

    2. **Authentication Check**: It attempts to create a `SixgillBaseClient` and requests
    an access token from the Cybersixgill authentication endpoint.

    3. **Validation**: If an access token is successfully retrieved, the action validates
    the connection as successful.

    4. **Completion**: The action terminates with a success or failure status and
    a descriptive message based on the authentication result.
