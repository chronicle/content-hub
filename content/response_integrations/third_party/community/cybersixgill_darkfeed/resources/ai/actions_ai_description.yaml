    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a utility function designed to verify the connectivity
    between Google SecOps and the Cybersixgill Darkfeed API. Its primary purpose is
    to ensure that the configured credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) are valid
    and that the environment can successfully establish a secure communication channel
    by obtaining an OAuth2 access token.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any user-configurable parameters within the action UI
    itself. It relies entirely on the global integration configuration settings:

    *   **Client Id**: The unique identifier for the Cybersixgill API account.

    *   **Client Secret**: The secret key associated with the Client ID used for authentication.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is typically used during the initial setup of the integration or for
    troubleshooting purposes when connectivity issues are suspected. It does not process
    entities or modify any data.


    ### Flow Description

    1.  **Extract Configuration**: The action retrieves the `Client Id` and `Client
    Secret` from the Cybersixgill integration settings.

    2.  **Initialize Manager**: It initializes the `SixgillEnrichManager` which handles
    the API interaction logic.

    3.  **Authentication Attempt**: The manager utilizes the `SixgillBaseClient` to
    request an access token from the Cybersixgill authentication endpoint.

    4.  **Verification**: If a valid access token is returned, the action confirms
    success. If an error occurs during the request, an exception is raised and reported.
