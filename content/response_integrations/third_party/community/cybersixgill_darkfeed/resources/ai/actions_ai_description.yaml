    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a connectivity test utility for the Cybersixgill Darkfeed
    integration. Its primary purpose is to verify that the Google SecOps environment
    can successfully authenticate and communicate with the Cybersixgill API using
    the provided credentials. This is typically used during initial setup or troubleshooting
    to ensure the integration is functional.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | N/A | N/A | N/A | This action does not have any input parameters. It uses the
    'Client Id' and 'Client Secret' defined in the integration configuration. |


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not process any entities or modify any data within Google SecOps
    or the Cybersixgill platform. It is strictly a health check for the API connection.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Extraction**: The action retrieves the `Client Id` and `Client
    Secret` from the integration's global settings.

    2. **Manager Initialization**: It initializes the `SixgillEnrichManager` which
    handles the communication logic.

    3. **Authentication Attempt**: The manager attempts to instantiate a `SixgillBaseClient`
    and calls `get_access_token()` to verify the credentials.

    4. **Execution Completion**: If an access token is successfully retrieved, the
    action returns a success status and message. If the process fails, an exception
    is raised with the error details.
