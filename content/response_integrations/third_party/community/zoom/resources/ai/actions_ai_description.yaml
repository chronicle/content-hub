  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Creates a scheduled or instant meeting in the Zoom platform for a specified host.
    This action allows security teams to quickly spin up communication channels during
    incident response directly from the SOAR platform.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Meeting Type | DDL | Yes | Specifies if the meeting is 'Instant' (starts immediately)
    or 'Scheduled'. |

    | Meeting Start Time | String | Yes | The start time for scheduled meetings in
    GMT format (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss). |

    | Meeting Topic | String | Yes | The title or subject of the meeting. |

    | Auto Recording Type | DDL | Yes | Configures automatic recording to 'local',

    | Host Email Address | String | Yes | The email address of the Zoom user who will
    host the meeting. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The action requires valid Zoom credentials (either JWT or OAuth) configured
    in the integration settings.

    - If 'Instant' is selected for the Meeting Type, the start time configuration
    is typically ignored by the API logic.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction:** The action retrieves meeting details (topic, type,
    time, duration, etc.) and the host's email from the input parameters.

    2. **Manager Initialization:** Initializes the Zoom API manager using the provided
    integration credentials.

    3. **Validation:** Checks if the meeting type and recording type are supported
    by the integration constants.

    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not run on entities; it uses the provided input parameters
    to perform the operation.

    - If a user with the specified email already exists in the Zoom account, the action
    will fail with a 'User Already Exists' error.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction**: The action retrieves the First Name, Last Name, Email,
    and User Type from the input parameters.

    2. **Authentication**: Initializes the Zoom Manager using the integration's configuration
    (supporting either OAuth or JWT credentials).

    3. **Existence Check**: Performs a GET request to Zoom's `/users/{email}` endpoint
    to verify if the user already exists.

    4. **User Creation**: If the user is not found, the action sends a POST request
    to the `/users` endpoint with a payload containing the user's details and the
    mapped license type code.

    5. **Result Processing**: Upon successful creation, the action captures the API
    response (user details) and adds it as a JSON result to the action output.

Enrich Entities:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Enriches USER entities with detailed profile information retrieved from Zoom.
    This action identifies users by their email address (entity identifier) and fetches
    comprehensive data such as user status, department, job title, and account settings
    from the Zoom API. The retrieved data is then flattened, prefixed with 'Zoom',
    and attached to the entity's additional properties within Google SecOps.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no action-specific parameters for this action. It relies on the global
    integration configuration for authentication (JWT or OAuth).


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action specifically targets entities of type **USER**.

    - It uses the entity's identifier as the email address to query the Zoom `/users/{user_email}`
    endpoint.

    - If an entity is successfully enriched, its `is_enriched` attribute is set to
    `True`.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the Zoom Manager using the integration's
    configuration parameters (JWT Token or OAuth credentials).

    2. **Entity Filtering**: It iterates through the target entities provided in the
    context and filters for those of type `USER`.

    3. **Data Retrieval**: For each valid USER entity, it calls the Zoom API to fetch
    user details using the entity's identifier.

    4. **Data Processing**: The retrieved JSON response is flattened into a single-level
    dictionary, and all keys are prefixed with 'Zoom' to avoid naming collisions.

    5. **Internal Update**: The processed data is added to the entity's `additional_properties`,
    and the entity is marked as enriched.

    6. **Finalization**: The action updates the entities in Google SecOps and returns
    a JSON result containing the raw data for all successfully enriched users.

Get Meeting Recording:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Fetches a specific Zoom meeting recording stored in the cloud using its Meeting
    ID. This action retrieves comprehensive metadata about the recording, including
    the sharing URL, file sizes, and recording types.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Meeting ID | String | Yes | The unique identifier of the Zoom meeting for which
    the recording is being retrieved. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction:** Retrieves the `Meeting ID` from the action input.

    2. **Authentication:** Establishes a connection to the Zoom API using configured
    OAuth or JWT credentials.

    3. **Data Retrieval:** Executes a GET request to the Zoom `/meetings/{meeting_id}/recordings`
    endpoint via the `ZoomManager`.

    4. **Output Generation:**
        * Extracts the `share_url` to provide as the primary result value.
        * Adds a direct link to the recording in the SOAR case wall/action results.
        * Attaches the full JSON metadata of the recording to the action results.

    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not process SOAR entities; it relies solely on the provided Meeting
    ID parameter. Either a JWT token or OAuth credentials (Account ID, Client ID,
    Client Secret) must be configured in the integration settings for the action to
    run.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action is designed to test the connectivity between Google SecOps and the
    Zoom platform. It validates that the provided credentials (either OAuth or JWT)
    are correct and that the environment can successfully communicate with the Zoom
    API.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no specific action parameters for this action. It relies entirely on
    the global integration configuration (JWT Token or OAuth credentials including
    Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret).


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action is typically used during the initial setup of the Zoom integration
    or for troubleshooting connection issues.

    - It requires at least one valid authentication method to be configured in the
    integration settings.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the Zoom Manager using the credentials
    provided in the integration configuration.

    2. **Authentication**: Depending on the configuration, it either uses a JWT token
    or performs an OAuth login to obtain an access token.

    3. **Connectivity Test**: It executes a GET request to the Zoom `/users` endpoint
    to verify that the API responds correctly.

    4. **Result Handling**: If the request is successful, it returns a success message.
    If any step fails (authentication error, network timeout, or API error), it captures
    the exception and reports a failure.
