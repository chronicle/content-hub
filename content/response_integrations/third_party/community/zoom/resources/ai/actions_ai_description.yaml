Create User:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description This action creates a new user account in Zoom. It allows
    security analysts or administrators to provision users directly from Google SecOps
    by providing basic identity details and license requirements. The action includes
    a built-in check to prevent creating duplicate users if the email address is already
    registered. ### Parameters | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description | | :---
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | | First Name | string | Yes | The first name of the user
    to be created. | | Last Name | string | Yes | The last name of the user to be
    created. | | Email | string | Yes | The unique email address for the new Zoom
    user account. | | User Type | ddl | Yes | The Zoom license type. Valid values:
    'Basic', 'Licensed', 'On-prem'. | ### Flow Description 1. **Authentication**:
    Connects to the Zoom API using either OAuth (Client ID, Secret, Account ID) or
    a legacy JWT token. 2. **Pre-existence Check**: Calls the Zoom API to verify if
    a user with the provided email already exists. 3. **Validation**: If the user
    exists, the action fails to prevent conflicts. 4. **User Creation**: If the user
    is unique, sends a POST request to the Zoom `/users` endpoint with the specified
    details. 5. **Output**: Returns the metadata of the successfully created user
    in JSON format.

Delete User:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Deletes a user permanently from a Zoom account. This action facilitates the offboarding
    process by removing a user identity and optionally transferring their associated
    data assets (meetings, webinars, and cloud recordings) to another active user
    within the organization.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Deleted User Email | String | Yes | The specific email address of the Zoom user
    account to be deleted. |

    | Transfer Email | String | No | The email address of the recipient user who will
    receive the deleted user's data. This should be provided if any 'Transfer' boolean
    is set to true. |

    | Transfer Meeting | Boolean | No | If set to 'true', all future scheduled meetings
    will be transferred to the recipient specified in 'Transfer Email'. Defaults to
    'false'. |

    | Transfer Recordings | Boolean | No | If set to 'true', all cloud recordings
    will be transferred to the recipient specified in 'Transfer Email'. Defaults to
    'false'. |

    | Transfer Webinar | Boolean | No | If set to 'true', all future scheduled webinars
    will be transferred to the recipient specified in 'Transfer Email'. Defaults to
    'false'. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The action includes internal logic to verify if the user actually possesses
    recordings, webinars, or meetings before attempting a transfer. If the user has
    no such assets, the corresponding transfer flag is automatically suppressed to
    ensure the API call succeeds.

    - If the target user for deletion is not found in the Zoom directory, the action
    will return a failed status with a 'user doesn't exist' notification.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: Extracts integration configuration (JWT or OAuth credentials)
    and action parameters.

    2. **Asset Validation**: Queries the Zoom API for the target user's recordings,
    webinars, and meetings to determine if there is content to transfer.

    3. **Conditional Logic**: Adjusts transfer flags based on the existence of data
    to prevent API errors during deletion.

    4. **Execution**: Sends a DELETE request to the Zoom API endpoint (`/Users/{email}`)
    including the transfer parameters.

    5. **Result Handling**: Parses the response; if successful (HTTP 204), updates
    the script result and notifies the case wall.

Enrich Entities:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Enriches USER entities with detailed account and profile information from Zoom.
    This action uses the entity's identifier (typically an email address) to query
    the Zoom API and retrieve comprehensive user data, including status, account type,
    and configuration settings. The retrieved data is then flattened, prefixed with
    "Zoom", and added to the entity's additional properties within Google SecOps.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any action-specific parameters. It relies on the global
    integration configuration for authentication.


    ### Additional Notes

    * Authentication can be performed using either a legacy JWT token or modern OAuth
    credentials (Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret) configured at the integration
    level.

    * Only entities identified as type USER (USERUNIQNAME) are processed; other entity
    types are ignored.


    ### Flow Description

    1.  **Authentication**: Initializes the Zoom API manager using credentials (OAuth
    or JWT) from the integration's configuration.

    2.  **Entity Filtering**: Iterates through all target entities in the current
    context, specifically selecting those of type USER.

    3.  **Data Retrieval**: For each valid USER entity, calls the Zoom API's `/users/{user_email}`
    endpoint to fetch the full user profile.

    4.  **Data Transformation**: Flattens the nested JSON response from Zoom and applies
    a "Zoom" prefix to all keys to prevent property collisions and improve readability.

    5.  **SOAR Update**: Updates the entity's `additional_properties` with the enriched
    data, marks the entity as enriched (`is_enriched = True`), and commits the changes
    to the case.

    6.  **Results**: Provides a summary of enriched entities and adds the raw API
    response to the action's JSON results for downstream use.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is designed to test and verify the connectivity between the
    Google SecOps platform and the Zoom API. It ensures that the integration's configuration,
    including authentication credentials, is correct and that the platform can successfully
    communicate with the Zoom service. This action is essential for troubleshooting
    setup issues or verifying API availability.


    ### Parameters

    This action does not require any specific input parameters. It utilizes the global
    configuration parameters provided at the integration level:

    * **JWT Token**: Used for JWT-based authentication (deprecated but supported).

    * **Account ID**: Used for OAuth authentication.

    * **Client ID**: Used for OAuth authentication.

    * **Client Secret**: Used for OAuth authentication.


    ### Additional Notes

    * The action requires at least one authentication method (JWT or OAuth) to be
    configured in the integration settings.

    * It performs a simple GET request to a standard Zoom API endpoint to confirm
    authorization and network reachability.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action retrieves the global Zoom integration configuration
    (JWT or OAuth credentials).

    2. **Manager Setup**: Initializes the Zoom Manager, which handles the authentication
    logic (e.g., exchanging OAuth credentials for an access token if necessary).

    3. **Connectivity Test**: Executes a `GET` request to the Zoom `/users` endpoint
    (`https://api.zoom.us/v2/users`) with a status filter for active users.

    4. **Validation**: Checks the response from the API. If the response is valid
    and successful (HTTP 200), connectivity is confirmed.

    5. **Completion**: If successful, it reports a 'Connected successfully' message;
    otherwise, it captures the exception and reports a failure status.
