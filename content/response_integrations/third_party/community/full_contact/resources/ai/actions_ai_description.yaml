    description: Enriches User entities using the Full Contact API. For each User
      entity (email address), it retrieves both person-level details such as title,
      gender, and LinkedIn profile, as well as company-level details like organization
      name, industry, employee count, and location by extracting the domain from the
      email address. The retrieved information is automatically appended to the entity's
      additional properties and returned as a JSON result.
