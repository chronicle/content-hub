Enrich Entities:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Enriches User entities by retrieving social, professional, and company-related
    data from the Full Contact API. This action takes an email address from a User
    entity and queries both the Full Contact Person and Company enrichment services
    to provide a comprehensive profile of the individual and their associated organization.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no specific action-level parameters for this action. It relies on the
    integration configuration (API Key).


    ### Additional Notes

    * The action specifically targets entities of type `USER` (mapped to `USERUNIQNAME`).

    * It extracts the domain from the email address to perform organizational enrichment.

    * Data is stored in the entity's `additional_properties` for visibility within
    the Google SecOps interface.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** The action fetches the Full Contact API Key from
    the integration settings.

    2. **Entity Filtering:** It iterates through the target entities and identifies
    those of type `USER` (representing email addresses).

    3. **Domain Extraction:** For each user, it splits the identifier to isolate the
    email domain.

    4. **External API Interaction:**
        * Calls the Full Contact `company.enrich` endpoint using the domain to get
    organizational details (e.g., employee count, industry, location).
        * Calls the Full Contact `person.enrich` endpoint using the full email to
    get individual details (e.g., gender, title, LinkedIn profile).
    5. **Data Mapping:** Extracts specific fields from the JSON responses and maps
    them to internal enrichment variables.

    6. **Entity Update:** Updates the entity's `additional_properties` with the retrieved
    data points and saves the changes back to Google SecOps.

    7. **Result Generation:** Adds a JSON result to the action output containing the
    raw enrichment data and concludes with a summary of enriched entities.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is used to verify connectivity and validate the configuration
    between Google SecOps and the Full Contact service. It performs a test request
    to the enrichment API to ensure that the API Key is valid and the external service
    is accessible.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not require any input parameters.


    ### Additional Notes

    - The action utilizes a hardcoded domain ('google.com') to verify the connectivity
    to the Full Contact Company Enrichment API.

    - The API Key must be configured within the 'Full Contact' integration settings
    for this action to function.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Setup**: The action initializes the Siemplify SDK and retrieves the integration
    configuration.

    2. **Authentication**: It fetches the API Key from the 'Full Contact' integration
    parameters.

    3. **Request**: It sends a POST request to the Full Contact `company.enrich` endpoint
    using 'google.com' as the target domain.

    4. **Validation**: The script checks the API response for an HTTP 401 status to
    detect authentication failures.

    5. **Completion**: If no errors occur during the API call, the action returns
    a successful status to the case wall.
