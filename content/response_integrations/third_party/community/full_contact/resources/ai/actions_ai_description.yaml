Enrich Entities:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nEnriches User entities using the Full\
    \ Contact API to provide deep contextual data about individuals and their associated\
    \ companies. The action extracts the domain from a user's email address to retrieve\
    \ company-level intelligence (such as size, industry, and location) and uses the\
    \ full email to retrieve personal professional details (such as job title and\
    \ social profiles).\n\n### Parameters\nThis action does not have any user-defined\
    \ parameters. It relies on the 'API Key' configured within the Full Contact integration\
    \ settings.\n\n### Flow Description\n1. **Configuration Retrieval:** Fetches the\
    \ Full Contact API Key from the integration configuration.\n2. **Entity Filtering:**\
    \ Iterates through the target entities and identifies those of type `USER`.\n\
    3. **Data Extraction:** For each User entity, it splits the identifier to extract\
    \ the domain name.\n4. **External API Interaction:** \n    * Calls the Full Contact\
    \ `company.enrich` endpoint using the extracted domain.\n    * Calls the Full\
    \ Contact `person.enrich` endpoint using the user's email address.\n5. **Data\
    \ Mapping:** Parses the API responses and maps attributes like company name, employee\
    \ count, industry, person title, and LinkedIn URL to the entity's additional properties.\n\
    6. **Internal Update:** Updates the entities within Google SecOps with the new\
    \ enrichment data and attaches a JSON result for further playbook use."

    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a diagnostic tool used to verify the connectivity between
    Google SecOps and the Full Contact API. Its primary purpose is to validate that
    the integration's configuration (specifically the API Key) is correct and that
    the external service is reachable.


    ### Parameters

    This action does not require any input parameters. It relies solely on the global
    integration configuration.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The script retrieves the 'API Key' from the Full
    Contact integration settings.

    2. **API Request**: It performs a POST request to the Full Contact `company.enrich`
    endpoint using a hardcoded domain ('google.com') to test the service response.

    3. **Validation**: The action checks the response for authentication errors (HTTP
    401). If the API key is invalid, it raises an exception.

    4. **Result**: If the request completes without authentication errors, the action
    returns a success message and a positive result value.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is intended for administrative testing and does not interact with
    or enrich entities within a case.
