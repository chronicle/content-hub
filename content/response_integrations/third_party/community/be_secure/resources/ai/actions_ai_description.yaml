    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a connectivity utility for the **beSECURE** integration.
    Its primary purpose is to verify that the connection between Google SecOps and
    the beSECURE instance is active and that the provided credentials (API Key) are
    valid. It performs a test API call to retrieve network information to confirm
    end-to-end communication.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no input parameters for this action. It relies entirely on the global
    integration configuration (URL, API Key, and SSL Verification settings).


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is typically used during the initial setup of the integration or for
    troubleshooting connectivity issues. It does not process entities and has no side
    effects on the beSECURE data.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The script retrieves the API Key, URL, and SSL
    verification settings from the integration's configuration.

    2. **Sanitization**: It cleans the API Key by removing any characters that are
    not alphanumeric or hyphens and ensures the URL includes the correct protocol
    (HTTP/HTTPS).

    3. **Connectivity Check**: It sends a GET request to the beSECURE `/json.cgi`
    endpoint using the `returnnetworks` action to verify that the API is responsive.

    4. **Validation**: The action parses the JSON response. If the response contains
    an "error" field, the action fails and returns the error details.

    5. **Completion**: If the API call succeeds without errors, the action returns
    a successful status, indicating the integration is properly configured.
