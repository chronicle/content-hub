    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a connectivity test designed to verify that the Google
    SecOps environment can successfully communicate with the **beSECURE** server.
    It ensures that the integration's configuration settings, such as the API Key
    and URL, are valid and that the network connection is established.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no input parameters for this action. It relies entirely on the integration's
    global configuration settings.


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action is primarily used for troubleshooting and initial setup validation.

    - The script performs a sanitization routine on the API Key to remove non-alphanumeric
    characters (except hyphens) before transmission.

    - SSL certificate verification is toggled based on the integration's configuration.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** Retrieves the API Key, URL, and SSL verification
    settings from the integration's configuration.

    2. **Input Preparation:** Cleans the API Key string and ensures the URL is prefixed
    with the appropriate protocol (http/https).

    3. **API Connectivity Test:** Executes a GET request to the beSECURE `/json.cgi`
    endpoint using the `returnnetworks` action to verify API access.

    4. **Response Validation:** Evaluates the JSON response from the server. If the
    response contains an 'error' field or the HTTP request fails, the action reports
    a failure.

    5. **Completion:** Ends the action with a success message if the connection is
    verified or a failure message detailing the error.
