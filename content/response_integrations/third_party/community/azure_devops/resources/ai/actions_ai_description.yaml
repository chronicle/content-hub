Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a connectivity test utility for the Azure DevOps integration.
    Its primary purpose is to verify that the Google SecOps environment can successfully
    communicate with the Azure DevOps API using the configured credentials and connection
    details. It serves as a diagnostic tool to ensure the integration is functional
    before executing more complex workflows.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any input parameters. It utilizes the following configuration
    parameters defined at the integration level:

    * **Personal Access Token**: The secret token used to authenticate requests to
    Azure DevOps.

    * **Organization**: The specific Azure DevOps organization name to connect to.

    * **Base URL**: The root URL for the Azure DevOps instance (e.g., https://dev.azure.com).


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is typically used during the initial setup of the integration or for
    troubleshooting authentication and network issues. It does not process any entities
    or modify any data.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction**: The script retrieves the Personal Access Token, Organization,
    and Base URL from the integration's configuration.

    2. **Authentication Setup**: It initializes a Basic Authentication object using
    the provided token.

    3. **Connection Initialization**: A connection is established to the Azure DevOps
    instance using the combined Base URL and Organization path.

    4. **API Verification**: The action attempts to call the `get_projects` method
    from the Azure DevOps Core Client to verify that the API is reachable and the
    credentials are valid.

    5. **Status Reporting**: The action returns a success message if the API call
    completes without error, or an error message detailing the failure if an exception
    occurs.

Trigger Azure Build:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Triggers a specific pipeline build in Azure DevOps using a build definition ID
    and custom variables. This action is designed to automate CI/CD workflows or remediation
    tasks that involve running Azure DevOps pipelines. It operates asynchronously,
    meaning it initiates the build and then monitors its progress until completion.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Build Definition Id | String | Yes | The unique identifier of the Azure DevOps
    pipeline (build definition) you want to trigger. |

    | Build Variables | Code (JSON) | Yes | A JSON-formatted string containing the
    variables to be passed to the pipeline execution. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action requires the Azure DevOps integration to be configured with a Project,
    Organization, and Personal Access Token (PAT).

    - The action is asynchronous and will poll the Azure DevOps API until the build
    reaches a terminal state (e.g., Succeeded, Failed, Canceled).


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: Retrieves integration configuration (Base URL, Organization,
    Project, PAT) and action parameters.

    2. **Trigger Build**: Sends a POST request to the Azure DevOps Builds API to queue
    a new build for the specified definition ID with the provided variables.

    3. **Async Transition**: If the build is successfully queued, the action captures
    the `build_id` and transitions to an asynchronous polling state.

    4. **Status Monitoring**: The `query_job` function periodically calls the Azure
    DevOps API to check the current status and result of the build.

    5. **Completion**: The action concludes as 'Completed' if the build succeeds or
    partially succeeds, and as 'Failed' if the build fails, is canceled, or encounters
    an error.

      Triggers a new build execution in Azure DevOps, which creates a new build record
      and starts a pipeline run.

Wait Until Web Resource Is Up:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action is designed to pause playbook execution until a specific web resource
    (URL) becomes available. It functions as an asynchronous check, meaning it will
    repeatedly poll the target URL until a successful response is received.


    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | URL | String | Yes | The web address of the resource to be monitored. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Input Retrieval**: The action extracts the URL parameter provided by the
    user.

    2. **Connectivity Check**: It attempts to reach the URL using an HTTP GET request
    with a 5-second timeout.

    3. **Success Validation**: The action evaluates the HTTP response. A response
    is considered successful if the status code is in the 2xx or 3xx range (resp.ok).

    4. **Execution State Handling**: If the check is successful, the action returns
    a COMPLETED state, allowing the playbook to proceed. If the check fails (e.g.,
    connection error or 4xx/5xx status), the action returns an INPROGRESS state, which
    signals the SOAR platform to retry the action later.


    ### Additional Notes

    * This action does not process or require any SecOps entities.

    * It is strictly a utility for synchronization and flow control within automated
    workflows.
