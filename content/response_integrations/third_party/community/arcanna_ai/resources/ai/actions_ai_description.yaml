    The `Get Arcanna decision` action retrieves an AI-driven inference decision from
    Arcanna.ai for a specific event associated with a job. It is designed to poll
    the Arcanna API until a decision is available or until a configured retry limit
    is reached. This action is typically used in automated playbooks after an event
    has been sent to Arcanna to obtain the final classification or recommendation.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Job Id | The unique identifier of the Arcanna Job. | string | Yes |

    | Event Id | The unique identifier of the specific event within the job for which
    the decision is being requested. | string | Yes |

    | Retry count | The maximum number of times the action will attempt to poll for
    a decision if the current status is pending. | string | Yes |

    | Seconds per retry | The duration (in seconds) to wait between each polling attempt.
    | string | Yes |

    | SSL Verification | Configuration parameter (from integration settings) indicating
    whether to verify the SSL certificate of the Arcanna server. | string | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1.  **Configuration Extraction:** The action retrieves integration settings (URL,
    API Key, SSL) and action-specific parameters (Job ID, Event ID, Retry settings).

    2.  **Client Initialization:** An `ArcannaClient` is initialized to facilitate
    communication with the Arcanna API.

    3.  **Polling Loop:** The action enters a loop that continues as long as the retry
    count hasn't been exhausted:
        *   It requests the status of the specific event from Arcanna.
        *   If the status is `pending_inference`, the action logs the status and waits
    for the specified `Seconds per retry` before the next attempt.
        *   If the status is `ERROR`, the action terminates with a failure state and
    logs the error details.
        *   If the status is `OK`, the action retrieves the decision, adds the full
    response to the `JsonResult`, and terminates successfully.
    4.  **Timeout Handling:** If the retry count is exhausted without receiving an
    `OK` or `ERROR` status, the action terminates with a failure, notifying the user
    that the decision could not be retrieved within the configured window.

    into a single JSON payload.

    4.  **Identifier Extraction**: If configured to use an existing ID, the action
    traverses the case JSON to find the specified identifier value.

    5.  **API Interaction**: Sends a POST request to the Arcanna API (`/api/v1/events/`)
    containing the Job ID and the prepared case payload.

    6.  **Results**: Captures the API response from Arcanna, adds it to the action's
    JSON results, and confirms the successful ingestion of the case.

SendEventToArcanna:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nSends event data (either a specific alert\
    \ or the entire case) from Google SecOps to Arcanna.ai for AI-driven analysis.\
    \ This action facilitates the integration between SOAR workflows and Arcanna.ai\
    \ jobs, allowing for automated decision-making or event processing based on specific\
    \ job configurations.\n\n### Parameters Description\n| Parameter | Type | Mandatory\
    \ | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Job ID** | string | Yes\
    \ | The unique identifier of the target AI job in Arcanna.ai that will receive\
    \ and process the data. |\n| **Username** | user | Yes | The username to be recorded\
    \ in Arcanna's audit logs for the event submission. |\n| **Event ID mapping field**\
    \ | string | No | A dot-notation path (e.g., `id` or `additional_data.external_id`)\
    \ used to extract a value from the payload to serve as the reference ID in Arcanna.ai.\
    \ |\n| **Send individual alerts from case** | boolean | No | If set to `true`,\
    \ the action only sends the data related to the current alert. If `false` (default),\
    \ the entire case object, including metadata and target entities, is sent. |\n\
    \n### Additional Notes\n- If `Send individual alerts from case` is enabled, the\
    \ action specifically filters for the current alert identifier within the case's\
    \ cyber alerts list to ensure context consistency.\n- When sending a full case,\
    \ the action automatically includes `target_entities` from the context in the\
    \ payload.\n\n### Flow Description\n1. **Initialization**: Retrieves the Arcanna\
    \ URL and API Key from the integration configuration and parses action parameters.\n\
    2. **Context Retrieval**: Fetches the full case details from Google SecOps.\n\
    3. **Payload Preparation**: \n    - If sending individual alerts: Iterates through\
    \ alerts in the case, matches the current alert, and extracts the reference ID\
    \ if a mapping field is provided.\n    - If sending the full case: Packages the\
    \ case data and appends target entity information.\n4. **External Transmission**:\
    \ Calls the Arcanna.ai API via a POST request to the `/api/v1/events/` endpoint\
    \ with the job ID and prepared payload.\n5. **Completion**: Records the API response\
    \ in the JSON result for downstream workflow use and sets the execution status."

SendJsonDocumentToArcanna:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action sends a custom JSON document to the Arcanna.ai platform for processing
    and analysis. It is designed to ingest arbitrary data structures into a specific
    Arcanna AI Job, allowing for flexible integration of various data sources with
    the Arcanna decision-making engine. Users can specify a specific field within
    the document to serve as the unique identifier in Arcanna.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | **Job ID** | The unique identifier of the Job in Arcanna.ai where the event
    should be ingested. | String | Yes |

    | **Identifier field** | A field name (supporting dot notation like `header.id`)
    within the JSON document to be used as the unique event ID in Arcanna. | String
    | No |

    | **Use document ID as ID in Arcanna** | If set to `True`, the action will attempt
    to extract and use the value from the 'Identifier field' as the event ID in Arcanna.
    If `False`, Arcanna generates its own unique ID. | Boolean | Yes |

    | **JSON Document** | The actual JSON object/document to be sent to Arcanna. Must
    be a valid JSON object (root cannot be a list). | Code | Yes |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The root of the provided JSON document must be a dictionary/object; providing
    a list at the root will cause the action to fail.

    - If 'Use document ID as ID in Arcanna' is `True`, the 'Identifier field' should
    be correctly configured to point to a valid field in the provided JSON.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Extraction:** The action retrieves integration settings (URL,
    API Key, SSL) and action parameters (Job ID, JSON body, and identifier settings).

    2. **JSON Validation:** The provided string is parsed into a Python dictionary.
    It validates that the input is a valid JSON object and not a list.

    3. **ID Extraction:** If configured to use an existing ID, the action uses a utility
    to navigate the JSON structure (supporting dot notation) to find the specified
    identifier value.

    4. **API Interaction:** The action calls the Arcanna API via a POST request, transmitting
    the Job ID and the JSON payload.

    5. **Result Handling:** The response from Arcanna is captured, added to the action's
    result JSON, and the action status is set based on the success of the API call.
