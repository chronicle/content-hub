Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is designed to test and verify the connectivity between Google
    SecOps and the Imgbb service. It ensures that the provided API key and network
    configurations are correct by attempting a sample image upload to the Imgbb API.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no parameters for this action. It relies solely on the global integration
    configuration (specifically the **API Key**).


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action performs a real POST request to the Imgbb API endpoint (`/1/upload`).

    - It uses a hardcoded base64 string representing a placeholder image to perform
    the connectivity test.

    - The uploaded test image is set to expire after 600 seconds (10 minutes).


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** The action retrieves the **API Key** from the
    Imgbb integration settings.

    2. **URL Construction:** It constructs the Imgbb API upload URL including the
    API key and a 600-second expiration parameter.

    3. **Connectivity Request:** The action sends a POST request to the Imgbb API
    containing a dummy base64-encoded image.

    4. **Status Validation:** It checks the HTTP response status. If the request is
    successful, it confirms connectivity; otherwise, it raises an exception.

    5. **Result Reporting:** The action concludes by reporting a success message to
    the Google SecOps interface.

Upload Image From Base64:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action uploads an image provided in base64 format to the Imgbb hosting service.
    It facilitates the conversion of local image data into a publicly accessible (though
    temporary) URL, which is then returned to Google SecOps for use in reports or
    subsequent automation steps.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Image in base64 | The base64 encoded string of the image you wish to upload
    to Imgbb. | String | Yes |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The uploaded image is configured with a hardcoded expiration of 600 seconds
    (10 minutes) within the API request.

    - This action does not process or rely on any entities (e.g., Hostnames, IPs)
    from the case; it operates purely on the provided parameter.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The script fetches the Imgbb API key and SSL verification
    settings from the integration configuration.

    2. **Parameter Extraction**: It extracts the `Image in base64` string provided
    by the user.

    3. **External API Call**: A POST request is sent to `api.imgbb.com` containing
    the base64 data.

    4. **Response Processing**: The script parses the JSON response to retrieve the
    hosted image URL.

    5. **Output Generation**: The image URL is added as a link to the action results,
    and the full response is attached as JSON for further reference.

Upload Image From File Path:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Uploads an image from a specified local file path to the Imgbb hosting service.
    This action is designed to facilitate the sharing of local image artifacts (like
    screenshots or captured visuals) by converting them into base64 format, uploading
    them to the cloud, and returning a publicly accessible URL.


    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Image File Path | The full system path to the image file that needs to be uploaded
    to Imgbb. | String | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The script retrieves the API Key and SSL verification
    settings from the Imgbb integration configuration.

    2. **File Processing**: It opens the image file located at the provided path,
    reads the binary data, and encodes it into a base64 string.

    3. **API Interaction**: Sends a POST request to the Imgbb API (`/1/upload`) containing
    the base64 image data. The request includes a hardcoded expiration parameter set
    to 600 seconds.

    4. **Data Extraction**: Parses the JSON response from Imgbb to extract the direct
    URL (`data.url`) of the hosted image.

    5. **Output Processing**: Updates the action results with the image URL, adds
    a clickable link titled "Image URL link" to the action UI, and provides the full
    JSON result for downstream logic.


    ### Additional Notes

    * The uploaded image is temporary and will expire after 10 minutes (600 seconds)
    as per the hardcoded API request parameters.

    * The action requires that the environment executing the script has file system
    read permissions for the provided path.
