    description: Uploads an image provided as a base64 string to the Imgbb hosting
      service. This action uses a POST request to send the image data to the Imgbb
      API, which generates a publicly accessible URL for the image. The resulting
      URL is then added as a clickable link in the action results and stored in the
      JSON output for downstream playbook use.

    description: Uploads a local image file to the Imgbb service. The action takes
      a file path as input, reads the file, encodes it as a base64 string, and performs
      a POST request to the Imgbb API. Upon success, it retrieves and returns the
      public URL of the uploaded image, which is set to expire after 600 seconds.
      The image URL is added to the action results as both a link and a JSON object.
