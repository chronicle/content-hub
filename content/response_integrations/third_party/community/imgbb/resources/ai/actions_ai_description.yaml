Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a utility designed to verify the connectivity between Google
    SecOps and the Imgbb service. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the provided
    API key is valid and that the network environment allows communication with the
    Imgbb API.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not require any input parameters.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is typically used during the initial setup of the Imgbb integration
    or for troubleshooting connection issues. It performs a sample image upload to
    the Imgbb `/1/upload` endpoint to confirm end-to-end functionality.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** The action fetches the 'API Key' from the integration's
    configuration settings.

    2. **Request Construction:** It prepares a POST request to the Imgbb upload API
    URL, including a hardcoded sample image in the payload.

    3. **Connectivity Test:** The action executes the POST request to the external
    service.

    4. **Validation:** It checks the HTTP response status. If the request is successful
    (status code 200), it confirms connectivity.

    5. **Finalization:** The action returns a success message and a boolean result
    to the SOAR platform.

      The action performs a POST request to the Imgbb upload endpoint, which results
      in a sample image being uploaded to the service to verify connectivity.

Upload Image From Base64:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Upload Image From Base64** action allows users to upload an image, provided
    in base64 format, to the Imgbb hosting service. This is useful for converting
    raw image data into a shareable URL that can be referenced in case notes, reports,
    or external communications. The action returns a public URL for the uploaded image.


    ### Parameters

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Image in base64 | The base64 encoded string of the image to be uploaded to Imgbb.
    | string | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action retrieves the Imgbb API Key and SSL
    verification settings from the integration configuration.

    2. **Parameter Extraction**: It extracts the base64 image string provided in the
    action parameters.

    3. **API Interaction**: A POST request is sent to the Imgbb API (`https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`)
    containing the image data. The request includes a hardcoded expiration of 600
    seconds (10 minutes).

    4. **Response Processing**: The action parses the JSON response from Imgbb to
    retrieve the generated image URL.

    5. **Output Generation**: The resulting URL is added to the action as a clickable
    link and included in the JSON result for downstream use in the playbook.


    ### Additional Notes

    * The uploaded image is set to expire automatically after 10 minutes as per the
    API call configuration.

Upload Image From File Path:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Upload Image From File Path** action facilitates the uploading of a local
    image file to the Imgbb hosting service. Its primary purpose is to take a file
    stored on the local file system, upload it to a cloud-based hosting provider,
    and retrieve a publicly accessible URL. This is particularly useful for sharing
    visual evidence or screenshots within a SOAR workflow.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | **Image File Path** | String | Yes | The absolute system path to the image file
    intended for upload. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The action requires a valid Imgbb API Key to be configured in the integration
    settings.

    - The uploaded image is configured with a hardcoded expiration of 600 seconds
    (10 minutes) within the API request.

    - This action does not operate on entities; it relies solely on the provided file
    path.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action retrieves the API Key and SSL verification
    settings from the integration configuration.

    2. **File Processing**: It opens the file specified in the **Image File Path**
    parameter, reads its binary content, and encodes it into a Base64 string.

    3. **External API Call**: A POST request is sent to the Imgbb API (`/1/upload`)
    containing the Base64 encoded image data.

    4. **Data Extraction**: Upon a successful response, the script parses the JSON
    to extract the direct URL of the uploaded image.

    5. **Result Reporting**: The script adds the image URL as a clickable link in
    the SOAR interface and includes it in the JSON result for use in subsequent playbook
    steps.
