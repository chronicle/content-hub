    Tests the connectivity between Google SecOps and the Imgbb service. This action
    is primarily used to verify that the integration's configuration (specifically
    the API Key) is correct and that the network path to the Imgbb API is open.


    ### Parameters

    There are no parameters for this action.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Retrieve Configuration**: The action fetches the 'API Key' from the Imgbb
    integration settings.

    2. **Endpoint Construction**: It builds the target API URL for the version 1 upload
    endpoint, including the API key and a default expiration of 600 seconds.

    3. **Test Request**: The action performs an HTTP POST request to Imgbb. It sends
    a hardcoded sample base64 image string as the payload to simulate a real upload.

    4. **Status Verification**: It checks the response status code using `raise_for_status()`.
    If the request fails, an exception is raised.

    5. **Completion**: If the request succeeds, the action terminates with a success
    message indicating connectivity is established.

      The action performs an HTTP POST request to the Imgbb upload endpoint, which
      creates a temporary image resource on the Imgbb servers to verify the connection.

UploadImageFromBase64:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Upload Image From Base64** action uploads an image provided in base64 format
    to the Imgbb image hosting service. This action is designed to convert raw image
    data into a publicly accessible URL, which is then returned to the Google SecOps
    platform as a link and a JSON result. This is useful for sharing screenshots or
    visual evidence gathered during an investigation.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | **Image in base64** | String | Yes | The base64 encoded string of the image
    you want to upload. |


    ### Additional Notes

    * **Expiration**: The action is configured to set an expiration time of 600 seconds
    (10 minutes) for the uploaded image on the Imgbb server.

    * **Connectivity**: Requires an active API Key for Imgbb and network access to
    `api.imgbb.com`.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Setup**: Retrieves the Imgbb API Key and SSL verification settings from the
    integration configuration.

    2. **Parameter Extraction**: Extracts the base64 image string provided in the
    action parameters.

    3. **External Request**: Sends a multipart/form-data POST request to the Imgbb
    upload API with the image data.

    4. **Response Processing**: Parses the JSON response from Imgbb to extract the
    generated image URL.

    5. **Result Reporting**: Adds the resulting image URL as a clickable link to the
    action output and stores the data in the result JSON for use in subsequent playbook
    steps.

      (the image) on their servers.

UploadImageFromFilePath:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Upload Image From File Path** action allows users to upload a local image
    file to the Imgbb hosting service. This is particularly useful for taking locally
    stored visual evidence (like screenshots or logs saved as images) and generating
    a shareable URL that can be referenced within a case or shared with other systems.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter Name | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | **Image File Path** | The absolute file path on the local system of the image
    you would like to upload to Imgbb. | String | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action retrieves the Imgbb API Key and SSL
    verification preferences from the integration's configuration settings.

    2. **File Conversion**: The script reads the file from the specified `Image File
    Path` and converts the binary data into a base64-encoded string.

    3. **External Upload**: It sends an HTTP POST request to the Imgbb API. The request
    includes the base64 string and a hardcoded expiration parameter (600 seconds).

    4. **Data Extraction**: The action parses the JSON response from Imgbb to extract
    the unique URL assigned to the uploaded image.

    5. **SOAR Integration**: Finally, it adds the image URL as a clickable link in
    the action results and includes the full details in the JSON result block for
    use in subsequent playbook steps.


    ### Additional Notes

    * **Expiration**: Uploaded images are set to expire and be deleted from Imgbb
    after 600 seconds (10 minutes).

    * **Entity Usage**: This action does not operate on SOAR entities (like IP addresses
    or Hostnames); it relies entirely on the provided string input for the file path.
