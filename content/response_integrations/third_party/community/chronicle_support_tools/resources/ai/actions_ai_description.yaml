Gather Remote Agent Datapoints:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nThis action is a diagnostic tool designed\
    \ to gather comprehensive troubleshooting data from a remote Google SecOps (Chronicle)\
    \ agent. It collects system-level performance metrics, agent configuration details,\
    \ and parses log files to identify errors related to specific integrations or\
    \ connectors. The gathered information is primarily intended for support and debugging\
    \ purposes, providing visibility into the agent's operational state and environment.\n\
    \n### Parameters Description\n| Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |\n\
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `IntegrationName` | String | Yes | The name of\
    \ the integration for which you want to analyze logs and configuration. |\n| `ConnectorName`\
    \ | String | No | The specific name of the connector to retrieve runner logs for.\
    \ If provided, the action will attempt to locate and parse the specific connector's\
    \ log files. |\n\n### Additional Notes\n- This action does not interact with entities.\
    \ It operates on the agent's local file system and system environment.\n- All\
    \ collected data is outputted to the action's execution logs (Script Log) rather\
    \ than being attached as insights or case comments.\n- Sensitive data such as\
    \ tokens, keys, and hostnames are filtered out from environment variable collection\
    \ to maintain security.\n\n### Flow Description\n1. **Configuration Extraction**:\
    \ Retrieves the target `IntegrationName` and `ConnectorName` from the action parameters.\n\
    2. **Agent Status Collection**: Reads and flattens the `agent_status.json` file\
    \ to extract versioning and integration details, and retrieves the OpenSSL version\
    \ and system time.\n3. **System Load Analysis**: Executes system commands (`lscpu`,\
    \ `uptime`, `free -h`) to capture CPU, memory, and uptime statistics. It also\
    \ collects non-sensitive environment variables.\n4. **File System Inspection**:\
    \ Lists the contents of the agent's working directory (`/opt/SiemplifyAgent`)\
    \ to verify file structures.\n5. **Log Parsing**: \n    - Scans the main `agent.log`\
    \ for entries marked as `ERROR`.\n    - If an integration and connector are specified,\
    \ it searches for the corresponding `connectors_runner.log` files and extracts\
    \ recent error messages.\n6. **Output**: Consolidates all gathered datapoints\
    \ and logs them to the Siemplify/Chronicle logger for review."
