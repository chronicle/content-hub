    description: Gathers diagnostic information and logs from a Remote Agent for troubleshooting
      purposes. This action collects agent status details, system load information
      (CPU, uptime, memory), file system metadata of the agent directory, and parses
      error logs from both the general agent log and specific connector logs based
      on the provided Integration and Connector names. It is designed to facilitate
      technical support and debugging of Remote Agent environments by aggregating
      performance and error data.
