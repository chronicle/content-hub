    description: Initiates an approval workflow by assigning a case or alert to a
      designated reviewer within Google SecOps. This action facilitates manual oversight
      by reassigning ownership to an Approval Manager and optionally moving grouped
      alerts into independent cases to isolate them for review. It further integrates
      with Slack to send automated notifications via a webhook, ensuring reviewers
      are promptly alerted to pending requests.
    external_data_mutation_explanation: Sends a notification message to a Slack channel
      via a configured Webhook URL to inform reviewers of pending approval requests.
    fetches_data: true
    internal_data_mutation_explanation: Reassigns the case or alert ownership and
      may programmatically move alerts into newly created cases, modifying internal
      case state.

    description: Processes manual approval responses within a workflow. This action
      validates if the requesting user is an authorized 'Approval Manager' or belongs
      to a required security role. Upon validation, it records whether a request was
      approved or denied based on user input, adds reviewer comments to the case wall,
      and sends a notification message to a Slack webhook with links to the specific
      case. It interacts with the internal Google SecOps API to verify user profiles
      and roles.
    external_data_mutation_explanation: Sends approval or denial notifications, including
      reviewer comments and case links, to a configured Slack webhook.
    fetches_data: true
    internal_data_mutation_explanation: Adds reviewer comments directly to the case
      and alert within the SOAR platform using the add_comment method.

    description: Assigns the current Google SecOps case to the user who manually triggered
      the playbook action. By identifying the 'original_requesting_user', it updates
      the case assignment via the internal SOAR API to ensure the correct analyst
