    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a diagnostic utility designed to verify the connectivity
    and authentication configuration between Google SecOps and the Cybersixgill platform.
    Its primary purpose is to ensure that the provided credentials (Client ID and
    Client Secret) are valid and that the system can successfully establish a connection
    to the Cybersixgill API.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no parameters for this action. It relies solely on the integration's
    global configuration (Client ID and Client Secret).


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is typically used during the initial setup or troubleshooting phase
    to confirm that the integration is functional. It does not process any entities
    or alert data.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action extracts the `Client Id` and `Client
    Secret` from the integration settings.

    2. **Client Initialization**: It initializes the Cybersixgill communication manager
    using the retrieved credentials.

    3. **Authentication Test**: The action attempts to retrieve an OAuth2 access token
    from the Cybersixgill API to verify connectivity.

    4. **Result Reporting**: If the token is successfully retrieved, the action completes
    with a success message. If an error occurs during the connection or authentication
    process, an exception is raised, indicating a configuration failure.
