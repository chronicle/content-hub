    ### General Description

    Verifies connectivity to the Cybersixgill platform by attempting to authenticate
    with the provided credentials. This action acts as a health check to ensure the
    integration can successfully communicate with the external API and retrieve an
    access token.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter Name | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Client Id | The unique client identifier provided by Cybersixgill for API access.
    | password | Yes |

    | Client Secret | The client secret associated with the Client Id for authentication.
    | password | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action extracts the `Client Id` and `Client Secret`
    from the integration configuration.

    2. **Client Creation**: It initializes the `SixgillEnrichManager` and attempts
    to create an instance of the `SixgillBaseClient` using the provided credentials.

    3. **Authentication Check**: The action calls the `get_access_token()` method
    to verify that the credentials are valid and that the platform can establish a
    connection.

    4. **Result Reporting**: Based on whether the access token is successfully retrieved,
    the action returns a success message or a failure message detailing the connection
    error.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not process any entities or fetch threat intelligence data; it
    is strictly used for testing connectivity.
