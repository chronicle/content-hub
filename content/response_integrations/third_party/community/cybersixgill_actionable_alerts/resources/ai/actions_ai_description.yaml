    # General Description

    Tests and verifies the integration connectivity with the Cybersixgill platform.
    It ensures that the provided API credentials are valid and that the environment
    can successfully communicate with the Cybersixgill services by attempting to authenticate.


    # Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | Client Id | Password | Yes | The unique Client ID provided by Cybersixgill for
    API access. |

    | Client Secret | Password | Yes | The Client Secret associated with the Client
    ID used for secure authentication. |


    # Flow Description

    1. **Parameter Extraction**: The action retrieves the 'Client Id' and 'Client
    Secret' from the action's configuration parameters.

    2. **Client Initialization**: It initializes the `SixgillEnrichManager` and internal
    API client with the extracted credentials.

    3. **Authentication Request**: The action attempts to fetch an OAuth2 access token
    from Cybersixgill's authentication endpoint.

    4. **Result Validation**: It checks if the token was successfully returned. If
    successful, it reports a connection success; otherwise, it catches exceptions
    and reports a failure with the specific error details.
