  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Adds one or more file hashes to the Bitdefender GravityZone blocklist. This action
    supports SHA256 and MD5 hash formats, allowing security teams to prevent the execution
    of known malicious files across their managed endpoints.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Hash List | String | Yes | A comma-separated list of SHA256 or MD5 hashes to
    be blocked. |

    | Source Info | String | Yes | A description or reason provided for the block
    action, such as a source alert name or threat classification. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: Connects to the Bitdefender GravityZone Control Center
    using the configured API Key and Access URL.

    2. **Validation and Parsing**: Splits the input 'Hash List' into individual hashes
    and categorizes them by type (MD5 vs. SHA256) using regex validation.

    3. **API Interaction**: Executes the `addToBlocklist` method via the Bitdefender
    API. If both MD5 and SHA256 hashes are provided, it makes separate API calls for
    each type.

    4. **Result Processing**: Returns a JSON summary of the hashes successfully submitted
    and identifies any hashes that were rejected due to unsupported formats.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not run on SOAR entities automatically; it requires the hashes
    to be passed explicitly via the 'Hash List' action parameter.

    and Virtual Machines) or 'Exchange' (for Security for Exchange). |

    | Location to Restore | String | No | The absolute path where items should be
    restored. If omitted, the original file location is used. |

    | Add Exclusion in Policy | Boolean | No | If true, the restored items are added
    to policy exclusions to prevent immediate re-quarantining by future scans. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Setup**: The action extracts the API credentials and the provided action
    parameters (IDs, service type, restoration path, and exclusion flag).

    2. **Manager Initialization**: Connects to the Bitdefender GravityZone Control
    Center using the Basic Authentication header.

    3. **API Call**: Executes the `createRestoreQuarantineItemTask` method by sending
    a POST request to the JSON-RPC quarantine endpoint specific to the selected service.

    4. **Completion**: Processes the response from the Bitdefender API to determine
    if the restoration task was successfully initiated and updates the action result
    accordingly.


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action performs a mutation on the external system by restoring files to
    an endpoint's filesystem.

    - Up to 100 item IDs can be processed in a single execution.

SetEndpointLabel:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Sets or resets a label for a specific endpoint within the Bitdefender GravityZone
    environment. This action is used for administrative organization and policy targeting
    by assigning a string-based label to a managed endpoint. It interacts directly
    with the Bitdefender Control Center API using the provided Endpoint ID and label
    string.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Label | String | Yes | The string value to assign as a label to the endpoint.
    Maximum length is 64 characters. Providing an empty string will reset/remove any
    existing label on the target endpoint. |

    | Endpoint ID | String | Yes | The unique identifier of the endpoint in Bitdefender
    GravityZone that will receive the label. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - Ensure the Label does not exceed the 64-character limit to avoid API errors.
