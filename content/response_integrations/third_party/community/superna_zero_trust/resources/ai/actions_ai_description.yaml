Ping:
  ai_description: "### General Description\nThe Ping action is designed to verify\
    \ the connectivity and health status of the Superna Eyeglass Zero Trust API. It\
    \ serves as a diagnostic tool to ensure that the Google SecOps environment can\
    \ successfully communicate with the Superna appliance using the provided credentials\
    \ and network configuration.\n\n### Parameters Description\n| Parameter | Type\
    \ | Mandatory | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| api_token | String\
    \ | Yes | The API key/token used to authenticate requests against the Superna\
    \ Zero Trust API. This is retrieved from the integration configuration. |\n| eyeglass_ip\
    \ | String | Yes | The IP address or hostname of the Superna Eyeglass appliance.\
    \ |\n| Verify SSL | Boolean | No | Determines whether the action should verify\
    \ the SSL certificate of the Superna appliance. Defaults to False. |\n\n### Additional\
    \ Notes\n- This action does not require or process any entities (IPs, Hosts, etc.)\
    \ from the alert context.\n- It specifically targets the `/sera/v1/healthcheck`\
    \ endpoint.\n- The action handles various network exceptions including timeouts,\
    \ connection errors, and HTTP errors to provide descriptive feedback in the SOAR\
    \ interface.\n\n### Flow Description\n1. **Configuration Extraction:** The action\
    \ retrieves the `api_token`, `eyeglass_ip`, and SSL verification settings from\
    \ the integration configuration.\n2. **URL Construction:** It builds the target\
    \ API URL by combining the protocol, provided IP, and the hardcoded health check\
    \ endpoint path.\n3. **Request Execution:** A GET request is sent to the Superna\
    \ appliance with the appropriate headers (API key and JSON content types).\n4.\
    \ **Response Handling:** \n    - If successful, it captures the response body\
    \ and marks the execution as completed.\n    - If a timeout, connection error,\
    \ or HTTP error occurs, it catches the exception and logs a specific failure message.\n\
    5. **Action Completion:** The action finishes by reporting the status and the\
    \ raw API response (or error details) back to the case wall."

SupernaSnapshotCriticalNasData:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Triggers a 'Cyber Snapshot' for critical NAS (Network Attached Storage) data using
    the Superna Eyeglass Zero Trust API. This action is designed to initiate data
    collection or protection workflows for specific paths identified as critical within
    the Superna environment, typically as a response to ransomware threats.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not have any input parameters. It relies entirely on the integration's
    configuration settings:

    * **api_token**: The API key used for authentication with the Superna Eyeglass
    API.

    * **eyeglass_ip**: The IP address or hostname of the Superna Eyeglass server.

    * **Verify SSL**: A boolean flag determining whether to verify the SSL certificate
    of the Superna Eyeglass server.


    ### Additional Notes

    * This action performs a **POST** request to the external system, which initiates
    a snapshot operation. This is considered a mutation of external data as it creates
    a new state/record (a snapshot) in Superna.

    * All credentials and connection details are managed at the integration configuration
    level, making the action itself parameter-less for the user during playbook execution.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The script extracts the API token, Eyeglass IP,
    and SSL verification settings from the SupernaZeroTrust integration configuration.

    2. **Endpoint Construction**: It formats the target API URL using the provided
    Eyeglass IP and the specific ransomware critical paths route.

    3. **API Interaction**: The script executes a POST request to the Superna Eyeglass
    server, passing the API key in the headers.

    4. **Outcome Reporting**: The action captures the response from the server. If
    successful, it returns the snapshot data as a JSON result. It includes comprehensive
    error handling for timeouts, connection issues, and HTTP errors to ensure the
    SOAR workflow can respond to communication failures.

SupernaZeroTrustUserLockout:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action facilitates the lockout of a suspected user from all Superna-protected
    Network Attached Storage (NAS). It is designed to mitigate threats such as ransomware
    by programmatically revoking user permissions and applying 'deny read' permissions
    to SMB shares through the Superna Eyeglass Zero Trust API.


    ### Parameters Description


    | Parameter | Mandatory | Type | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | UserName | True | String | The identifier of the user to be locked out. Must
    be provided in 'domain\\username' or 'user@domain' format. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action retrieves connection details, including
    the Eyeglass IP, API Token, and SSL verification settings, from the integration
    configuration.

    2. **Input Processing**: The provided `UserName` is extracted from the action
    parameters and URL-encoded to ensure safe transmission via HTTP.

    3. **Request Construction**: The action constructs the full API URL for the Superna
    lockout endpoint using the Eyeglass IP and encoded username.

    4. **Execution**: An authenticated POST request is sent to the Superna Eyeglass
    server to trigger the lockout mechanism.

    5. **Result Handling**: The action evaluates the response from the server. It
    handles various scenarios including successful execution, timeouts, connection
    errors, and HTTP errors, updating the action result accordingly.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not iterate over entities but rather operates on a single user
    provided via the `UserName` parameter.

SupernaZeroTrustUserUnLock:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description This action unlocks a user that was previously locked
    out from Superna protected NAS storage via the Superna Eyeglass Zero Trust API.
    It facilitates rapid recovery of user access after security incidents or accidental
    lockouts. ### Parameters Description | Parameter Name | Expected Type | Mandatory
    | Description | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | UserName | String | Yes | The
    name of the user to be unlocked. Expected formats are 'domain\\username' or 'username@domain'.

    including the Eyeglass IP, API token, and SSL verification settings. 2. **Parameter
    Extraction**: It extracts the mandatory `UserName` parameter and applies URL-encoding
    to ensure compatibility with the REST API endpoint. 3. **API Call**: Constructs
    a POST request to the `/sera/v2/ransomware/unlock/` endpoint using the configured
    Eyeglass IP and API key. 4. **Response Handling**: The action captures the response
    from the Superna Eyeglass server. It specifically handles success, timeouts, connection
    errors, and HTTP errors to determine the final execution state in Google SecOps.
