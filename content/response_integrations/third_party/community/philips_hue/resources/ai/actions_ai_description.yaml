    \ GET request to the Bridge's API to confirm a valid connection.\n\n### Parameters\
    \ Description\n| Parameter Name | Expected Type | Mandatory | Description |\n\
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| N/A | N/A | N/A | This action does not have any\

    \ action does not require or process any entities.\n- The 'Bridge IP' and 'Authorized\
    \ Username' must be correctly configured in the PhilipsHUE integration settings\

    \ The action initializes the Siemplify context and extracts integration-level\
    \ configuration (Bridge IP and Authorized Username).\n2. **Manager Setup**: A\
    \ `PhilipsManager` instance is created using the retrieved configuration to manage\
    \ the HTTP session.\n3. **Connectivity Test**: The action calls the `test_connectivity`\
    \ method, which sends an authenticated GET request to the Philips HUE Bridge base\
    \ API endpoint.\n4. **Result Handling**: \n    - If the request is successful\
    \ (HTTP 200), the action returns a success message.\n    - If the request fails\
    \ or an exception occurs, the action catches the error and reports a connection\
    \ failure message."

TurnOffLight:

    ### General Description

    The **Turn Off Light** action allows users to programmatically deactivate a specific
    light bulb connected to a Philips Hue Bridge. This action is designed to interact
    with the Philips Hue API to manage the physical state of lighting equipment based
    on security automation or manual triggers.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Light ID | The unique identifier assigned to the specific light bulb by the
    Philips Hue Bridge. | String | Yes |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Setup**: The action initializes by retrieving the Bridge IP and Authorized
    Username from the integration configuration.

    2. **Identification**: It searches for the provided `Light ID` on the Philips
    Hue Bridge to confirm its existence.

    3. **Reachability Verification**: If the ID is found, the action checks if the
    light bulb is currently online and reachable by the Bridge.

    4. **State Modification**: It sends a command to the Bridge to update the light's
    power state to 'off'.

    5. **Completion**: The action returns the execution status and details regarding
    the light's reachability and the success of the operation.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action requires a properly configured Philips Hue Bridge IP and a valid 'Authorized
    Username' within the integration settings to function correctly. If the light
    is unreachable (e.g., powered off at the switch), the action will fail.

TurnOnLightAndColor:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action interacts with a Philips Hue Bridge to turn on a specific light bulb
    and configure its color and alert effect. It is typically used for physical notification
    or status signaling in a security operations center (SOC) environment.


    ### Parameters Description


    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Light ID | String | Yes | The unique identifier of the Philips Hue light bulb
    to control. |

    | Color | DDL | Yes | The color to apply to the light. Options include: Red, Orange,
    Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink. |

    | Alert effect | DDL | Yes | Defines the visual behavior when the light turns
    on. 'None' turns it on normally, 'Flicker-Once' flashes once, and 'Flicker-Loop'
    flashes for 15 seconds. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not operate on Google SecOps entities (like IP or Hostname)
    but instead uses manually provided parameters.

    - The action requires valid Philips Hue Bridge IP and Authorized Username configuration
    in the integration settings.


    ### Flow Description

    1.  **Initialization**: Extracts the bridge configuration and action parameters
    (Light ID, Color, and Effect).

    2.  **Validation**: Connects to the Philips Hue Bridge to verify if the provided
    `Light ID` exists.

    3.  **Connectivity Check**: Verifies if the specific light bulb is currently reachable
    by the bridge.

    4.  **State Mutation**: If the light is available, it sends a PUT request to the
    Philips Hue API to turn the light on with the specified hue (mapped from color
    name) and alert effect.

    5.  **Reporting**: Returns a JSON result containing the light ID and execution
    details, and completes the action with a success or failure message.
