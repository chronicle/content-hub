Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The Ping action is designed to verify the connectivity between Google SecOps and
    the Philips HUE Bridge. It serves as a diagnostic tool to ensure that the integration
    parameters provided in the configuration (Bridge IP and Authorized Username) are
    correct and that the Bridge is reachable over the network.


    ### Parameters Description

    This action does not require any additional input parameters at the time of execution.
    It relies entirely on the integration's configuration settings:

    | Parameter Name | Description | Expected Type | Mandatory |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Bridge IP | The IP address of the target Philips HUE bridge. | String | Yes
    |

    | Authorized Username | The API username authorized to communicate with the bridge.
    | String | Yes |


    ### Additional Notes

    If the action fails, it typically indicates a network routing issue, an incorrect
    IP address, or an invalid/expired authorized username.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action extracts the 'Bridge IP' and 'Authorized
    Username' from the integration's configuration context.

    2. **Manager Initialization**: It initializes the `PhilipsManager` with the retrieved
    credentials.

    3. **Connectivity Test**: The action calls the `test_connectivity` method, which
    performs a GET request to the Philips HUE API base URL (https://<Bridge IP>/api/<Username>).

    4. **Result Reporting**: If the HTTP request is successful, the action returns
    a success message. If an error occurs (e.g., timeout, 404, or 403), it captures
    the exception and reports the failure.

Turn Off Light:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action turns off a specific Philips HUE light bulb identified by its unique
    ID. It is useful for physical security response or office automation scenarios
    where lighting control is integrated into security workflows.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Light ID | string | Yes | The unique identifier of the light you want to turn
    off. You can find this ID via the HUE Bridge API or the Philips HUE developer
    portal. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action requires the Philips HUE integration to be configured with a valid
    **Bridge IP** and an **Authorized Username**.

    - The action checks for light reachability before attempting to turn it off. If
    the light is unreachable (e.g., powered off at the switch), the action will fail
    with a specific error message.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action retrieves connection details (Bridge IP, Username)
    and the target Light ID.

    2. **Validation**: It queries the HUE bridge to verify if the provided `Light
    ID` exists.

    3. **Reachability Check**: If the ID exists, it checks if the light is currently
    reachable by the bridge.

    4. **Execution**: If reachable, it sends a PUT request to the bridge's state endpoint
    to set the 'on' state to `false`.

    5. **Completion**: The action returns a success message and JSON results if the
    state change is confirmed by the bridge.

      status to 'off' via a PUT request to the HUE Bridge API.

Turn On Light and Color:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action controls a Philips Hue light bulb by its unique identifier. It allows
    users to turn a light on, set it to a predefined color, and trigger specific alert
    effects (such as flickering). It is primarily used for physical notification or
    visual signaling within an environment.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Light ID | string | Yes | The unique identifier of the light bulb to be controlled.
    |

    | Color | ddl | Yes | The color to apply to the light. Options include: Red, Orange,
    Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink. |

    | Alert effect | ddl | Yes | Defines the visual behavior when turning on. 'None'
    turns it on normally, 'Flicker-Once' flashes it once, and 'Flicker-Loop' flashes
    it for 15 seconds. |


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: Retrieves the Philips Hue Bridge IP and Authorized Username
    from the integration configuration.

    2. **Validation**: Checks if the specified `Light ID` exists on the Bridge using
    a GET request.

    3. **Reachability Check**: Verifies if the light is currently reachable by the
    Bridge.

    4. **State Modification**: Sends a PUT request to the Philips Hue API to set the
    light to 'on', apply the mapped hue color code, and trigger the selected alert
    effect.

    5. **Reporting**: Returns a success message if the light state was successfully
    updated, otherwise reports a failure or reachability issue.
