    description: Turns off a specific Philips HUE light using its unique identifier.
      The action connects to the Philips HUE Bridge API, verifies the existence and
      reachability of the target light ID, and then executes a PUT request to update
      the device state to off. It provides feedback on whether the light was successfully
      reached and updated.

      performing a PUT request to update its state. Supported colors include Red,
      Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Pink, while alert effects include single
      or looping flickers. It is used to provide visual indicators of security alerts
      within a physical environment.
