    description: Analyzes a provided string of text to identify spelling errors and
      suggest potential corrections based on word frequency. The action cleans the
      input text by removing non-alphabetic characters (while preserving spaces, parentheses,
      and '@' symbols), filters out URLs and email addresses, and compares the remaining
      words against a dictionary. It identifies unknown words and retrieves a list
      of candidate corrections for each. Results are output as a structured JSON object
      and presented in a data table named 'Found spelling mistakes' within the case.
      The action includes a built-in allowlist for common technology and industry
      terms.
