    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a utility designed to verify the connectivity between Google
    SecOps and the **Spell Checker** integration. Its primary purpose is to confirm
    that the integration configuration is correct and that the system can successfully
    execute actions within this integration namespace.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no parameters configured for this action.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not process entities, call external APIs, or use the `SpellCheckerManager`
    logic. It is a standard 'Health Check' action.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialize Context**: The action initializes the Siemplify action module
    to interface with the SOAR platform.

    2. **Terminate with Success**: The script immediately ends the execution, returning
    a static string 'Spell Checker is connected' and a boolean success status of `True`.

    ### General Description

    The **Spelling Check** action identifies misspelled words within a provided text
    string and suggests potential corrections based on word frequency and a predefined
    allowlist. It is a utility-focused action used to validate the accuracy of text
    data, such as logs, descriptions, or email bodies, within a playbook flow.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Input | String | No | The text string that will be analyzed by the Spell Checker.
    If left empty, the action will likely process an empty string and return zero
    results. |


    ### Flow Description

    1.  **Text Sanitization**: The action retrieves the input text and applies regex
    patterns to remove special characters and symbols, while retaining letters, spaces,
    parentheses, and '@' symbols.

    2.  **Tokenization**: The sanitized text is split into individual words. The action
    filters out potential false positives like email addresses (containing '@') and
    URLs (containing 'http').

    3.  **Spell Checking**: The word list is compared against a dictionary provided
    by the `pyspellchecker` library and a custom allowlist (containing tech-specific
    terms like 'siemplify', 'playbook', and 'saas').

    4.  **Suggestion Generation**: For every word identified as misspelled, the action
    generates a list of likely candidates for the correct spelling.

    5.  **Reporting**: The results are compiled into a JSON object and a Data Table
    named "Found spelling mistakes," displaying the original misspelled word alongside
    its recommended corrections.
