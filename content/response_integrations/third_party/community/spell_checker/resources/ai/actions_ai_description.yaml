    ### General Description

    Verifies the connectivity and configuration of the Spell Checker integration.
    This action is a standard health check used to ensure that the integration is
    properly configured and reachable within the Google SecOps environment.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no parameters for this action.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not perform any actual spell-checking or external API calls.
    It serves as a heartbeat or 'Ping' to confirm the integration's operational status.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the Google SecOps (Siemplify) action
    module.

    2. **Status Confirmation**: The action concludes by returning a success message
    ('Spell Checker is connected') to the platform, indicating the integration is
    active.

Spelling Check:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action analyzes a provided string of text to identify misspelled words and
    suggest likely corrections. It utilizes a frequency-based spell-checking algorithm
    and incorporates a custom allowlist of common technology terms (e.g., 'Microsoft',
    'Siemplify', 'SaaS') to reduce false positives. The action is primarily used for
    data sanitization or pre-processing text within a playbook.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Input | String | No | The raw text that will be checked for spelling errors.
    If left empty, the action will complete with zero mistakes found. |


    ### Additional Notes

    - The action automatically filters out email addresses and URLs from the spell-checking
    process to avoid flagging technical identifiers as errors.

    - It performs text normalization by removing special characters and numbers before
    analysis.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Text Extraction**: Retrieves the string from the `Input` parameter.

    2. **Normalization**: Cleans the text using regular expressions to remove non-alphabetic
    characters while preserving spaces and specific symbols.

    3. **Filtering**: Splits the text into individual words and excludes any tokens
    containing '@' (emails) or 'http' (URLs).

    4. **Misspelling Identification**: Compares the remaining words against a dictionary
    and a custom technology-focused allowlist to identify unknown words.

    5. **Suggestion Generation**: For every identified misspelled word, the engine
    generates a list of potential candidates based on word frequency.

    6. **Reporting**: Populates a JSON result with the findings and creates a data
    table named 'Found spelling mistakes' in the Google SecOps case containing the
    original words and their recommended corrections.
