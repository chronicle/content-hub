    ### General Description

    Verifies the connectivity and configuration of the Spell Checker integration.
    This action is typically used during the initial setup or for troubleshooting
    to ensure that the integration is responsive and properly initialized within the
    Google SecOps environment.


    ### Parameters

    There are no parameters for this action.


    ### Additional Notes

    This action is a simple 'Ping' test. It does not perform any text analysis, nor
    does it interact with the SpellCheckerManager or any external web services. It
    serves strictly as a heartbeat check.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the SiemplifyAction object to interface
    with the Google SecOps platform.

    2. **Status Reporting**: The action immediately terminates and returns a success
    message stating 'Spell Checker is connected', confirming the integration is operational.

Spelling Check:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    This action analyzes a provided block of text to identify potential spelling errors
    and suggest likely corrections based on word frequency. It uses a local spell-checking
    engine with an augmented dictionary of technology-related terms (e.g., 'siemplify',
    'saas', 'playbook'). The action is primarily intended for cleaning up notes, descriptions,
    or logs within a case.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Input | String | No | The raw text to be checked for spelling errors. If left
    empty, the action will likely process an empty string and return zero mistakes.
    |


    ### Additional Notes

    - This action does not interact with external APIs; it uses a local library and
    dictionary.

    - It automatically filters out emails and URLs to prevent them from being flagged
    as spelling errors.

    - The result includes both a JSON object and a human-readable data table.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Text Preprocessing**: The action cleans the 'Input' text by removing special
    characters, newlines, and carriage returns using regular expressions.

    2. **Tokenization**: The cleaned text is split into individual words. Any tokens
    containing '@' (emails) or 'http' (URLs) are filtered out.

    3. **Validation**: The remaining words are checked against a local dictionary
    (including a custom allowlist of technical terms) to identify unknown words.

    4. **Suggestion Generation**: For every unknown word, the engine generates a list
    of potential candidates for the correct spelling.

    5. **Reporting**: The action builds a JSON result map and a data table titled
    'Found spelling mistakes' which maps original words to their recommended corrections.
