Invite User:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Invite User** action allows administrators to invite a specific user to
    a designated team within a Docker Hub organization using the user's email address.
    This action facilitates user management and access control directly from the Google
    SecOps platform.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Type | Mandatory | Description |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Team | string | Yes | The specific team name within the organization where the
    user will be added. |

    | Organization | string | Yes | The Docker Hub organization name that owns the
    team. |

    | Email | string | Yes | The email address of the user who will receive the invitation.
    |


    ### Additional Notes

    This action requires valid Docker Hub administrator credentials (Username and
    Password) configured in the integration settings to perform the invitation. It
    does not operate on case entities but uses manual parameters.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization:** The action retrieves the Docker Hub credentials from the
    integration configuration and the specific Organization, Team, and Email from
    the action parameters.

    2. **Authentication:** It establishes a session with the Docker Hub API, performing
    a login to obtain a JWT authentication token.

    3. **Invitation Request:** It sends a POST request to the Docker Hub API endpoint
    (`/orgs/{org}/groups/{team}/members/`) with the target user's email address in
    the request body.

    4. **Completion:** The action reports whether the invitation was successfully
    sent to the external service.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Tests the connectivity and authentication between Google SecOps and Docker Hub.
    The action verifies that the provided integration credentials (Username and Password)
    are valid by performing a login and attempting to access a standard Docker Hub
    API endpoint. This utility action is primarily used to troubleshoot or confirm
    that the Docker Hub integration is functioning correctly.


    ### Parameters Description

    There are no action-specific parameters for this action. It relies entirely on
    the global integration configuration for authentication.


    ### Additional Notes

    * Although the script metadata variable `SCRIPT_NAME` is set to 'Invite User',
    the actual logic implemented in the script performs a connectivity test ('Ping').

    * The action suppresses 404 errors during the connectivity test, treating them
    as a pass for the purpose of verifying that the endpoint is reachable.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The action fetches the 'Username' and 'Password'
    from the Docker Hub integration configuration.

    2. **Authentication**: It initializes the `DockerHub` manager class, which automatically
    triggers a login sequence by sending a POST request to the Docker Hub login endpoint
    to retrieve a JWT token.

    3. **Connectivity Test**: The script calls the `test_connectivity` method, which
    makes a GET request to the Docker Hub `_catalog` endpoint.

    4. **Result Finalization**: If the authentication and request are successful (or
    handleable 404 errors), the action completes with a success status.
