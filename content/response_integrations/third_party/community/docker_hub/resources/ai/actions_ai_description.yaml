Invite User:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    Invites a user to a specific team within a Docker Hub organization using their
    email address. This action facilitates user management and access control by automating
    the invitation process to organizational groups.


    ### Parameters Description

    | Parameter | Description | Type | Mandatory | Notes |

    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

    | Organization | The name of the Docker Hub organization where the team resides.
    | string | True | Organizations are collections of teams and repositories. |

    | Team | The specific team name within the organization to which the user will
    be invited. | string | True | Teams are groups of Docker Hub users. |

    | Email | The email address of the user to be invited. | string | True | The invitation
    is sent to this address. |


    ### Additional Notes

    This action does not operate on entities directly; it uses the provided parameters
    to execute the invitation logic. It requires valid Docker Hub credentials (Username
    and Password) configured in the integration settings.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Initialization**: The action initializes the Docker Hub manager using the
    username and password from the integration configuration.

    2. **Parameter Retrieval**: It retrieves the `Organization`, `Team`, and `Email`
    values from the action parameters.

    3. **API Interaction**: The action calls the Docker Hub API via a POST request
    to the organization's group members endpoint (`/orgs/{org}/groups/{team}/members/`).

    4. **Completion**: If the request is successful, it returns a success message
    and sets the execution state to completed. If an error occurs, it captures the
    traceback and fails the action.

Ping:
  ai_description: >-
    ### General Description

    The **Ping** action is a diagnostic utility used to verify the connectivity between
    Google SecOps and the Docker Hub platform. Its primary purpose is to validate
    that the integration's configuration (specifically the Username and Password)
    is correct and that the network path to the Docker Hub API is open.


    ### Parameters

    This action does not require any input parameters. It utilizes the global configuration
    settings provided at the integration level.


    ### Flow Description

    1. **Credential Retrieval**: The action fetches the Username and Password from
    the Docker Hub integration configuration.

    2. **Authentication**: It initializes a connection to Docker Hub, which involves
    a POST request to the login endpoint to retrieve a JWT (JSON Web Token) for session
    authentication.

    3. **Connectivity Verification**: The action executes a GET request to the `_catalog`
    endpoint of the Docker Hub API.

    4. **Status Reporting**: If the API responds successfully, the action concludes
    with a success status, confirming the integration is operational.
