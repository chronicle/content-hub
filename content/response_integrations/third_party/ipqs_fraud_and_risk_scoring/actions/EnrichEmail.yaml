name: Enrich Email
description: This action provides real-time email address reputation scoring and validation
    with hundreds of syntax & DNS checks. The API can be leveraged to determine if
    the email address inbox exists with the mail service provider and is able to accept
    new messages. In addition, users can determine if the email address has a poor
    reputation or has recently been associated with abuse or threats. Additional risk
    scoring can detect disposable and temporary mail services as well as emails with
    a history of fraudulent behavior online.
