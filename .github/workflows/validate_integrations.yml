# Define permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN.
# 'contents: read' is needed for actions/checkout to clone the repository.
# 'issues: write' is the minimal permission required to add comments to PRs or Issues.
# This is more restrictive and secure than 'pull-requests: write', as it prevents
# the workflow from performing actions like merging pull requests.
