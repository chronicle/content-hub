description: This action Scans links and domains in real-time to detect suspicious
    URLs using trusted machine learning models. These machine learning models can
    accurately identify phishing links, malware URLs, viruses, parked domains, and
    suspicious URLs with real-time risk scores. In addition, the machine learning
    models can confidently classify poor reputation domains, suspicious links, and
    phishing URLs with a real-time API integration. Features such as parking domain
    detection, domain spam scores, reputation checks, and domain age, elevates URL
    intelligence to a whole new level.
