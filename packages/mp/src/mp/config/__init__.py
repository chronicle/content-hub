"""Package for managing the application's configuration settings.

This package provides a command-line interface to configure various
aspects of the application, such as the path to the marketplace repository
and the number of parallel processes to use. It allows users to set these
configurations via command-line options and displays the current
configuration when requested. The configurations are stored and accessed
through the `core.config` module.
