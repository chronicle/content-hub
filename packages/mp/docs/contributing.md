# Contributing to MP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to `mp` as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
- Update the tests to cover your changes
- Ensure the test suite passes
- Ensure your code passes static type checking and linting
- Keep the PR as focused as possible, if you have multiple features, submit multiple PRs

## Code Style

This project uses:

- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type checking

Before submitting your code, run:

```bash
mp format
mp check --static-type-check
```

## Testing

All new features should include appropriate tests. Run the tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Additionally, you can use the pre-configured run/debug configurations. When using these, please ensure the correct Python interpreter from the project's virtual environment is selected in the specific run configuration you are using. See [ide_configuration](installation.md#ide-configuration) for the correct interpreter paths.
